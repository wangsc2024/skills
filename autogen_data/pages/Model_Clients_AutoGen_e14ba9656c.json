  "title": "Model Clients — AutoGen",
  "content": "AutoGen provides a suite of built-in model clients for using ChatCompletion API. All model clients implement the ChatCompletionClient protocol class.\n\nCurrently we support the following built-in model clients:\n\nOpenAIChatCompletionClient: for OpenAI models and models with OpenAI API compatibility (e.g., Gemini).\n\nAzureOpenAIChatCompletionClient: for Azure OpenAI models.\n\nAzureAIChatCompletionClient: for GitHub models and models hosted on Azure.\n\nOllamaChatCompletionClient (Experimental): for local models hosted on Ollama.\n\nAnthropicChatCompletionClient (Experimental): for models hosted on Anthropic.\n\nSKChatCompletionAdapter: adapter for Semantic Kernel AI connectors.\n\nFor more information on how to use these model clients, please refer to the documentation of each client.\n\nAutoGen uses standard Python logging module to log events like model calls and responses. The logger name is autogen_core.EVENT_LOGGER_NAME, and the event type is LLMCall.\n\nTo call a model client, you can use the create() method. This example uses the OpenAIChatCompletionClient to call an OpenAI model.\n\nYou can use the create_stream() method to create a chat completion request with streaming token chunks.\n\nThe last response in the streaming response is always the final response of the type CreateResult.\n\nThe default usage response is to return zero values. To enable usage, see create_stream() for more details.\n\nStructured output can be enabled by setting the response_format field in OpenAIChatCompletionClient and AzureOpenAIChatCompletionClient to as a Pydantic BaseModel class.\n\nStructured output is only available for models that support it. It also requires the model client to support structured output as well. Currently, the OpenAIChatCompletionClient and AzureOpenAIChatCompletionClient support structured output.\n\nYou also use the extra_create_args parameter in the create() method to set the response_format field so that the structured output can be configured for each request.\n\nautogen_ext implements ChatCompletionCache that can wrap any ChatCompletionClient. Using this wrapper avoids incurring token usage when querying the underlying client with the same prompt multiple times.\n\nChatCompletionCache uses a CacheStore protocol. We have implemented some useful variants of CacheStore including DiskCacheStore and RedisStore.\n\nHere’s an example of using diskcache for local caching:\n\nInspecting cached_client.total_usage() (or model_client.total_usage()) before and after a cached response should yield idential counts.\n\nNote that the caching is sensitive to the exact arguments provided to cached_client.create or cached_client.create_stream, so changing tools or json_output arguments might lead to a cache miss.\n\nLet’s create a simple AI agent that can respond to messages using the ChatCompletion API.\n\nThe SimpleAgent class is a subclass of the autogen_core.RoutedAgent class for the convenience of automatically routing messages to the appropriate handlers. It has a single handler, handle_user_message, which handles message from the user. It uses the ChatCompletionClient to generate a response to the message. It then returns the response to the user, following the direct communication model.\n\nThe cancellation_token of the type autogen_core.CancellationToken is used to cancel asynchronous operations. It is linked to async calls inside the message handlers and can be used by the caller to cancel the handlers.\n\nThe above SimpleAgent always responds with a fresh context that contains only the system message and the latest user’s message. We can use model context classes from autogen_core.model_context to make the agent “remember” previous conversations. See the Model Context page for more details.\n\nIn the examples above, we show that you can provide the API key through the api_key argument. Importantly, the OpenAI and Azure OpenAI clients use the openai package, which will automatically read an api key from the environment variable if one is not provided.\n\nFor OpenAI, you can set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.\n\nFor Azure OpenAI, you can set the AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.\n\nIn addition, for Gemini (Beta), you can set the GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable.\n\nThis is a good practice to explore, as it avoids including sensitive api keys in your code.",
