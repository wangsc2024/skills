  "content": "In this section you’ll learn how to create a multi-agent team (or simply team) using AutoGen. A team is a group of agents that work together to achieve a common goal.\n\nWe’ll first show you how to create and run a team. We’ll then explain how to observe the team’s behavior, which is crucial for debugging and understanding the team’s performance, and common operations to control the team’s behavior.\n\nAgentChat supports several team presets:\n\nRoundRobinGroupChat: A team that runs a group chat with participants taking turns in a round-robin fashion (covered on this page). Tutorial\n\nSelectorGroupChat: A team that selects the next speaker using a ChatCompletion model after each message. Tutorial\n\nMagenticOneGroupChat: A generalist multi-agent system for solving open-ended web and file-based tasks across a variety of domains. Tutorial\n\nSwarm: A team that uses HandoffMessage to signal transitions between agents. Tutorial\n\nWhen should you use a team?\n\nTeams are for complex tasks that require collaboration and diverse expertise. However, they also demand more scaffolding to steer compared to single agents. While AutoGen simplifies the process of working with teams, start with a single agent for simpler tasks, and transition to a multi-agent team when a single agent proves inadequate. Ensure that you have optimized your single agent with the appropriate tools and instructions before moving to a team-based approach.\n\nRoundRobinGroupChat is a simple yet effective team configuration where all agents share the same context and take turns responding in a round-robin fashion. Each agent, during its turn, broadcasts its response to all other agents, ensuring that the entire team maintains a consistent context.\n\nWe will begin by creating a team with two AssistantAgent and a TextMentionTermination condition that stops the team when a specific word is detected in the agent’s response.\n\nThe two-agent team implements the reflection pattern, a multi-agent design pattern where a critic agent evaluates the responses of a primary agent. Learn more about the reflection pattern using the Core API.\n\nLet’s call the run() method to start the team with a task.\n\nThe team runs the agents until the termination condition was met. In this case, the team ran agents following a round-robin order until the the termination condition was met when the word “APPROVE” was detected in the agent’s response. When the team stops, it returns a TaskResult object with all the messages produced by the agents in the team.\n\nSimilar to the agent’s on_messages_stream() method, you can stream the team’s messages while it is running by calling the run_stream() method. This method returns a generator that yields messages produced by the agents in the team as they are generated, with the final item being the TaskResult object.\n\nAs demonstrated in the example above, you can determine the reason why the team stopped by checking the stop_reason attribute.\n\nThe Console() method provides a convenient way to print messages to the console with proper formatting.\n\nYou can reset the team by calling the reset() method. This method will clear the team’s state, including all agents. It will call the each agent’s on_reset() method to clear the agent’s state.\n\nIt is usually a good idea to reset the team if the next task is not related to the previous task. However, if the next task is related to the previous task, you don’t need to reset and you can instead resume the team.\n\nApart from automatic termination conditions such as TextMentionTermination that stops the team based on the internal state of the team, you can also stop the team from outside by using the ExternalTermination.\n\nCalling set() on ExternalTermination will stop the team when the current agent’s turn is over. Thus, the team may not stop immediately. This allows the current agent to finish its turn and broadcast the final message to the team before the team stops, keeping the team’s state consistent.\n\nFrom the ouput above, you can see the team stopped because the external termination condition was met, but the speaking agent was able to finish its turn before the team stopped.\n\nTeams are stateful and maintains the conversation history and context after each run, unless you reset the team.\n\nYou can resume a team to continue from where it left off by calling the run() or run_stream() method again without a new task. RoundRobinGroupChat will continue from the next agent in the round-robin order.\n\nYou can see the team resumed from where it left off in the output above, and the first message is from the next agent after the last agent that spoke before the team stopped.\n\nLet’s resume the team again with a new task while keeping the context about the previous task.\n\nYou can abort a call to run() or run_stream() during execution by setting a CancellationToken passed to the cancellation_token parameter.\n\nDifferent from stopping a team, aborting a team will immediately stop the team and raise a CancelledError exception.\n\nThe caller will get a CancelledError exception when the team is aborted.\n\nStarting with version 0.6.2, you can use AssistantAgent with max_tool_iterations to run the agent with multiple iterations of tool calls. So you may not need to use a single-agent team if you just want to run the agent in a tool-calling loop.\n\nOften, you may want to run a single agent in a team configuration. This is useful for running the AssistantAgent in a loop until a termination condition is met.\n\nThis is different from running the AssistantAgent using its run() or run_stream() method, which only runs the agent for one step and returns the result. See AssistantAgent for more details about a single step.\n\nHere is an example of running a single agent in a RoundRobinGroupChat team configuration with a TextMessageTermination condition. The task is to increment a number until it reaches 10 using a tool. The agent will keep calling the tool until the number reaches 10, and then it will return a final TextMessage which will stop the run.\n\nThe key is to focus on the termination condition. In this example, we use a TextMessageTermination condition that stops the team when the agent stop producing ToolCallSummaryMessage. The team will keep running until the agent produces a TextMessage with the final result.\n\nYou can also use other termination conditions to control the agent. See Termination Conditions for more details.",

The descriptions of the changing leaves, cool air, and various autumn traditions make it easy for readers to envision and feel the charm of fall. Here are a few suggestions to enhance its impact:\n\n1. **Structure Variation**: Consider breaking some lines with a hyphen or ellipsis for dramatic effect or emphasis. For instance, “Sweaters wrapped tight as twilight nears— / Fall’s charming embrace, as warm as it appears.\"\n\n2. **Sensory Details**: While the poem already evokes visual and tactile senses, incorporating other senses such as sound or smell could deepen the immersion. For example, include the scent of wood smoke or the crunch of leaves underfoot.\n\n3. **Metaphorical Language**: Adding metaphors or similes can further enrich the imagery. For example, you might compare the leaves falling to a golden rain or the chill in the air to a gentle whisper.\n\nOverall, it’s a lovely depiction of fall.
