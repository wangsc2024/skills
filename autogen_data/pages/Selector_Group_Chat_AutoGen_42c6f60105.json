  "content": "SelectorGroupChat implements a team where participants take turns broadcasting messages to all other members. A generative model (e.g., an LLM) selects the next speaker based on the shared context, enabling dynamic, context-aware collaboration.\n\nKey features include:\n\nModel-based speaker selection\n\nConfigurable participant roles and descriptions\n\nPrevention of consecutive turns by the same speaker (optional)\n\nCustomizable selection prompting\n\nCustomizable selection function to override the default model-based selection\n\nCustomizable candidate function to narrow-down the set of agents for selection using model\n\nSelectorGroupChat is a high-level API. For more control and customization, refer to the Group Chat Pattern in the Core API documentation to implement your own group chat logic.\n\nSelectorGroupChat is a group chat similar to RoundRobinGroupChat, but with a model-based next speaker selection mechanism. When the team receives a task through run() or run_stream(), the following steps are executed:\n\nThe team analyzes the current conversation context, including the conversation history and participants’ name and description attributes, to determine the next speaker using a model. By default, the team will not select the same speak consecutively unless it is the only agent available. This can be changed by setting allow_repeated_speaker=True. You can also override the model by providing a custom selection function.\n\nThe team prompts the selected speaker agent to provide a response, which is then broadcasted to all other participants.\n\nThe termination condition is checked to determine if the conversation should end, if not, the process repeats from step 1.\n\nWhen the conversation ends, the team returns the TaskResult containing the conversation history from this task.\n\nOnce the team finishes the task, the conversation context is kept within the team and all participants, so the next task can continue from the previous conversation context. You can reset the conversation context by calling reset().\n\nIn this section, we will demonstrate how to use SelectorGroupChat with a simple example for a web search and data analysis task.\n\nThis system uses three specialized agents:\n\nPlanning Agent: The strategic coordinator that breaks down complex tasks into manageable subtasks.\n\nWeb Search Agent: An information retrieval specialist that interfaces with the search_web_tool.\n\nData Analyst Agent: An agent specialist in performing calculations equipped with percentage_change_tool.\n\nThe tools search_web_tool and percentage_change_tool are external tools that the agents can use to perform their tasks.\n\nLet’s create the specialized agents using the AssistantAgent class. It is important to note that the agents’ name and description attributes are used by the model to determine the next speaker, so it is recommended to provide meaningful names and descriptions.\n\nBy default, AssistantAgent returns the tool output as the response. If your tool does not return a well-formed string in natural language format, you may want to add a reflection step within the agent by setting reflect_on_tool_use=True when creating the agent. This will allow the agent to reflect on the tool output and provide a natural language response.\n\nThe task is received by the SelectorGroupChat which, based on agent descriptions, selects the most appropriate agent to handle the initial task (typically the Planning Agent).\n\nThe Planning Agent analyzes the task and breaks it down into subtasks, assigning each to the most appropriate agent using the format: <agent> : <task>\n\nBased on the conversation context and agent descriptions, the SelectorGroupChat manager dynamically selects the next agent to handle their assigned subtask.\n\nThe Web Search Agent performs searches one at a time, storing results in the shared conversation history.\n\nThe Data Analyst processes the gathered information using available calculation tools when selected.\n\nThe workflow continues with agents being dynamically selected until either:\n\nThe Planning Agent determines all subtasks are complete and sends “TERMINATE”\n\nAn alternative termination condition is met (e.g., a maximum number of messages)\n\nWhen defining your agents, make sure to include a helpful description since this is used to decide which agent to select next.\n\nLet’s use two termination conditions: TextMentionTermination to end the conversation when the Planning Agent sends “TERMINATE”, and MaxMessageTermination to limit the conversation to 25 messages to avoid infinite loop.\n\nSelectorGroupChat uses a model to select the next speaker based on the conversation context. We will use a custom selector prompt to properly align with the workflow.\n\nThe string variables available in the selector prompt are:\n\n{participants}: The names of candidates for selection. The format is [\"<name1>\", \"<name2>\", ...].\n\n{roles}: A newline-separated list of names and descriptions of the candidate agents. The format for each line is: \"<name> : <description>\".\n\n{history}: The conversation history formatted as a double newline separated of names and message content. The format for each message is: \"<name> : <message content>\".\n\nTry not to overload the model with too much instruction in the selector prompt.\n\nWhat is too much? It depends on the capabilities of the model you are using. For GPT-4o and equivalents, you can use a selector prompt with a condition for when each speaker should be selected. For smaller models such as Phi-4, you should keep the selector prompt as simple as possible such as the one used in this example.\n\nGenerally, if you find yourself writing multiple conditions for each agent, it is a sign that you should consider using a custom selection function, or breaking down the task into smaller, sequential tasks to be handled by separate agents or teams.\n\nLet’s create the team with the agents, termination conditions, and custom selector prompt.\n\nNow we run the team with a task to find information about an NBA player.\n\nAs we can see, after the Web Search Agent conducts the necessary searches and the Data Analyst Agent completes the necessary calculations, we find that Dwayne Wade was the Miami Heat player with the highest points in the 2006-2007 season, and the percentage change in his total rebounds between the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons is 85.98%!\n\nOften times we want better control over the selection process. To this end, we can set the selector_func argument with a custom selector function to override the default model-based selection. This allows us to implement more complex selection logic and state-based transitions.\n\nFor instance, we want the Planning Agent to speak immediately after any specialized agent to check the progress.\n\nReturning None from the custom selector function will use the default model-based selection.\n\nCustom selector functions are not serialized when .dump_component() is called on the SelectorGroupChat team . If you need to serialize team configurations with custom selector functions, consider implementing custom workflows and serialization logic.\n\nYou can see from the conversation log that the Planning Agent always speaks immediately after the specialized agents.\n\nEach participant agent only makes one step (executing tools, generating a response, etc.) on each turn. If you want an AssistantAgent to repeat until it stop returning a ToolCallSummaryMessage when it has finished running all the tools it needs to run, you can do so by checking the last message and returning the agent if it is a ToolCallSummaryMessage.\n\nOne more possible requirement might be to automatically select the next speaker from a filtered list of agents. For this, we can set candidate_func parameter with a custom candidate function to filter down the list of potential agents for speaker selection for each turn of groupchat.\n\nThis allow us to restrict speaker selection to a specific set of agents after a given agent.\n\nThe candidate_func is only valid if selector_func is not set. Returning None or an empty list [] from the custom candidate function will raise a ValueError.\n\nYou can see from the conversation log that the Planning Agent returns to conversation once the Web Search Agent and Data Analyst Agent took their turns and it finds that the task was not finished as expected so it called the WebSearchAgent again to get rebound values and then called DataAnalysetAgent to get the percentage change.\n\nWe can add UserProxyAgent to the team to provide user feedback during a run. See Human-in-the-Loop for more details about UserProxyAgent.\n\nTo use the UserProxyAgent in the web search example, we simply add it to the team and update the selector function to always check for user feedback after the planning agent speaks. If the user responds with \"APPROVE\", the conversation continues, otherwise, the planning agent tries again, until the user approves.\n\nNow, the user’s feedback is incorporated into the conversation flow, and the user can approve or reject the planning agent’s decisions.\n\nSo far in the examples, we have used a gpt-4o model. Models like gpt-4o and gemini-1.5-flash are great at following instructions, so you can have relatively detailed instructions in the selector prompt for the team and the system messages for each agent to guide their behavior.\n\nHowever, if you are using a reasoning model like o3-mini, you will need to keep the selector prompt and system messages as simple and to the point as possible. This is because the reasoning models are already good at coming up with their own instructions given the context provided to them.\n\nThis also means that we don’t need a planning agent to break down the task anymore, since the SelectorGroupChat that uses a reasoning model can do that on its own.\n\nIn the following example, we will use o3-mini as the model for the agents and the team, and we will not use a planning agent. Also, we are keeping the selector prompt and system messages as simple as possible.\n\nFor more guidance on how to prompt reasoning models, see the Azure AI Services Blog on Prompt Engineering for OpenAI’s O1 and O3-mini Reasoning Models",

      "description": "AgentChat Selector Group Chat Selector Group Chat# SelectorGroupChat implements a team where participants take turns broadcasting messages to all other members. A generative model (e.g., an LLM) selects the next speaker based on the shared context, enabling dynamic, context-aware collaboration. Key features include: Model-based speaker selection Configurable participant roles and descriptions Prevention of consecutive turns by the same speaker (optional) Customizable selection prompting Customizable selection function to override the default model-based selection Customizable candidate function to narrow-down the set of agents for selection using model Note SelectorGroupChat is a high-level API. For more control and customization, refer to the Group Chat Pattern in the Core API documentation to implement your own group chat logic. How Does it Work?# SelectorGroupChat is a group chat similar to RoundRobinGroupChat, but with a model-based next speaker selection mechanism. When the team receives a task through run() or run_stream(), the following steps are executed: The team analyzes the current conversation context, including the conversation history and participants’ name and description attributes, to determine the next speaker using a model. By default, the team will not select the same speak consecutively unless it is the only agent available. This can be changed by setting allow_repeated_speaker=True. You can also override the model by providing a custom selection function. The team prompts the selected speaker agent to provide a response, which is then broadcasted to all other participants. The termination condition is checked to determine if the conversation should end, if not, the process repeats from step 1. When the conversation ends, the team returns the TaskResult containing the conversation history from this task. Once the team finishes the task, the conversation context is kept within the team and all participants, so the next task can continue from the previous conversation context. You can reset the conversation context by calling reset(). In this section, we will demonstrate how to use SelectorGroupChat with a simple example for a web search and data analysis task. Example: Web Search/Analysis# from typing import List, Sequence from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent from autogen_agentchat.conditions import MaxMessageTermination, TextMentionTermination from autogen_agentchat.messages import BaseAgentEvent, BaseChatMessage from autogen_agentchat.teams import SelectorGroupChat from autogen_agentchat.ui import Console from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient Agents# This system uses three specialized agents: Planning Agent: The strategic coordinator that breaks down complex tasks into manageable subtasks. Web Search Agent: An information retrieval specialist that interfaces with the search_web_tool. Data Analyst Agent: An agent specialist in performing calculations equipped with percentage_change_tool. The tools search_web_tool and percentage_change_tool are external tools that the agents can use to perform their tasks. # Note: This example uses mock tools instead of real APIs for demonstration purposes def search_web_tool(query: str) -> str: if \"2006-2007\" in query: return \"\"\"Here are the total points scored by Miami Heat players in the 2006-2007 season: Udonis Haslem: 844 points Dwayne Wade: 1397 points James Posey: 550 points ... \"\"\" elif \"2007-2008\" in query: return \"The number of total rebounds for Dwayne Wade in the Miami Heat season 2007-2008 is 214.\" elif \"2008-2009\" in query: return \"The number of total rebounds for Dwayne Wade in the Miami Heat season 2008-2009 is 398.\" return \"No data found.\" def percentage_change_tool(start: float, end: float) -> float: return ((end - start) / start) * 100 Let’s create the specialized agents using the AssistantAgent class. It is important to note that the agents’ name and description attributes are used by the model to determine the next speaker, so it is recommended to provide meaningful names and descriptions. model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"gpt-4o\") planning_agent = AssistantAgent( \"PlanningAgent\", description=\"An agent for planning tasks, this agent should be the first to engage when given a new task.\", model_client=model_client, system_message=\"\"\" You are a planning agent. Your job is to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks. Your team members are: WebSearchAgent: Searches for information DataAnalystAgent: Performs calculations You only plan and delegate tasks - you do not execute them yourself. When assigning tasks, use this format: 1. <agent> : <task> After all tasks are complete, summarize the findings and end with \"TERMINATE\". \"\"\", ) web_search_agent = AssistantAgent( \"WebSearchAgent\", description=\"An agent for searching information on the web.\", tools=[search_web_tool], model_client=model_client, system_message=\"\"\" You are a web search agent. Your only tool is search_tool - use it to find information. You make only one search call at a time. Once you have the results, you never do calculations based on them. \"\"\", ) data_analyst_agent = AssistantAgent( \"DataAnalystAgent\", description=\"An agent for performing calculations.\", model_client=model_client, tools=[percentage_change_tool], system_message=\"\"\" You are a data analyst. Given the tasks you have been assigned, you should analyze the data and provide results using the tools provided. If you have not seen the data, ask for it. \"\"\", ) Note By default, AssistantAgent returns the tool output as the response. If your tool does not return a well-formed string in natural language format, you may want to add a reflection step within the agent by setting reflect_on_tool_use=True when creating the agent. This will allow the agent to reflect on the tool output and provide a natural language response. Workflow# The task is received by the SelectorGroupChat which, based on agent descriptions, selects the most appropriate agent to handle the initial task (typically the Planning Agent). The Planning Agent analyzes the task and breaks it down into subtasks, assigning each to the most appropriate agent using the format: <agent> : <task> Based on the conversation context and agent descriptions, the SelectorGroupChat manager dynamically selects the next agent to handle their assigned subtask. The Web Search Agent performs searches one at a time, storing results in the shared conversation history. The Data Analyst processes the gathered information using available calculation tools when selected. The workflow continues with agents being dynamically selected until either: The Planning Agent determines all subtasks are complete and sends “TERMINATE” An alternative termination condition is met (e.g., a maximum number of messages) When defining your agents, make sure to include a helpful description since this is used to decide which agent to select next. Termination Conditions# Let’s use two termination conditions: TextMentionTermination to end the conversation when the Planning Agent sends “TERMINATE”, and MaxMessageTermination to limit the conversation to 25 messages to avoid infinite loop. text_mention_termination = TextMentionTermination(\"TERMINATE\") max_messages_termination = MaxMessageTermination(max_messages=25) termination = text_mention_termination | max_messages_termination Selector Prompt# SelectorGroupChat uses a model to select the next speaker based on the conversation context. We will use a custom selector prompt to properly align with the workflow. selector_prompt = \"\"\"Select an agent to perform task. {roles} Current conversation context: {history} Read the above conversation, then select an agent from {participants} to perform the next task. Make sure the planner agent has assigned tasks before other agents start working. Only select one agent. \"\"\" The string variables available in the selector prompt are: {participants}: The names of candidates for selection. The format is [\"<name1>\", \"<name2>\", ...]. {roles}: A newline-separated list of names and descriptions of the candidate agents. The format for each line is: \"<name> : <description>\". {history}: The conversation history formatted as a double newline separated of names and message content. The format for each message is: \"<name> : <message content>\". Tip Try not to overload the model with too much instruction in the selector prompt. What is too much? It depends on the capabilities of the model you are using. For GPT-4o and equivalents, you can use a selector prompt with a condition for when each speaker should be selected. For smaller models such as Phi-4, you should keep the selector prompt as simple as possible such as the one used in this example. Generally, if you find yourself writing multiple conditions for each agent, it is a sign that you should consider using a custom selection function, or breaking down the task into smaller, sequential tasks to be handled by separate agents or teams.

Using Reasoning Models# So far in the examples, we have used a gpt-4o model. Models like gpt-4o and gemini-1.5-flash are great at following instructions, so you can have relatively detailed instructions in the selector prompt for the team and the system messages for each agent to guide their behavior. However, if you are using a reasoning model like o3-mini, you will need to keep the selector prompt and system messages as simple and to the point as possible. This is because the reasoning models are already good at coming up with their own instructions given the context provided to them. This also means that we don’t need a planning agent to break down the task anymore, since the SelectorGroupChat that uses a reasoning model can do that on its own. In the following example, we will use o3-mini as the model for the agents and the team, and we will not use a planning agent. Also, we are keeping the selector prompt and system messages as simple as possible. model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"o3-mini\") web_search_agent = AssistantAgent( \"WebSearchAgent\", description=\"An agent for searching information on the web.\", tools=[search_web_tool], model_client=model_client, system_message=\"\"\"Use web search tool to find information.\"\"\", ) data_analyst_agent = AssistantAgent( \"DataAnalystAgent\", description=\"An agent for performing calculations.\", model_client=model_client, tools=[percentage_change_tool], system_message=\"\"\"Use tool to perform calculation.

      "description": "AgentChat Selector Group Chat Selector Group Chat# SelectorGroupChat implements a team where participants take turns broadcasting messages to all other members. A generative model (e.g., an LLM) selects the next speaker based on the shared context, enabling dynamic, context-aware collaboration. Key features include: Model-based speaker selection Configurable participant roles and descriptions Prevention of consecutive turns by the same speaker (optional) Customizable selection prompting Customizable selection function to override the default model-based selection Customizable candidate function to narrow-down the set of agents for selection using model Note SelectorGroupChat is a high-level API. For more control and customization, refer to the Group Chat Pattern in the Core API documentation to implement your own group chat logic. How Does it Work?# SelectorGroupChat is a group chat similar to RoundRobinGroupChat, but with a model-based next speaker selection mechanism. When the team receives a task through run() or run_stream(), the following steps are executed: The team analyzes the current conversation context, including the conversation history and participants’ name and description attributes, to determine the next speaker using a model. By default, the team will not select the same speak consecutively unless it is the only agent available. This can be changed by setting allow_repeated_speaker=True. You can also override the model by providing a custom selection function. The team prompts the selected speaker agent to provide a response, which is then broadcasted to all other participants. The termination condition is checked to determine if the conversation should end, if not, the process repeats from step 1. When the conversation ends, the team returns the TaskResult containing the conversation history from this task. Once the team finishes the task, the conversation context is kept within the team and all participants, so the next task can continue from the previous conversation context. You can reset the conversation context by calling reset(). In this section, we will demonstrate how to use SelectorGroupChat with a simple example for a web search and data analysis task. Example: Web Search/Analysis# from typing import List, Sequence from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent from autogen_agentchat.conditions import MaxMessageTermination, TextMentionTermination from autogen_agentchat.messages import BaseAgentEvent, BaseChatMessage from autogen_agentchat.teams import SelectorGroupChat from autogen_agentchat.ui import Console from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient Agents# This system uses three specialized agents: Planning Agent: The strategic coordinator that breaks down complex tasks into manageable subtasks. Web Search Agent: An information retrieval specialist that interfaces with the search_web_tool. Data Analyst Agent: An agent specialist in performing calculations equipped with percentage_change_tool. The tools search_web_tool and percentage_change_tool are external tools that the agents can use to perform their tasks. # Note: This example uses mock tools instead of real APIs for demonstration purposes def search_web_tool(query: str) -> str: if \"2006-2007\" in query: return \"\"\"Here are the total points scored by Miami Heat players in the 2006-2007 season: Udonis Haslem: 844 points Dwayne Wade: 1397 points James Posey: 550 points ... \"\"\" elif \"2007-2008\" in query: return \"The number of total rebounds for Dwayne Wade in the Miami Heat season 2007-2008 is 214.\" elif \"2008-2009\" in query: return \"The number of total rebounds for Dwayne Wade in the Miami Heat season 2008-2009 is 398.\" return \"No data found.\" def percentage_change_tool(start: float, end: float) -> float: return ((end - start) / start) * 100 Let’s create the specialized agents using the AssistantAgent class. It is important to note that the agents’ name and description attributes are used by the model to determine the next speaker, so it is recommended to provide meaningful names and descriptions. model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"gpt-4o\") planning_agent = AssistantAgent( \"PlanningAgent\", description=\"An agent for planning tasks, this agent should be the first to engage when given a new task.\", model_client=model_client, system_message=\"\"\" You are a planning agent. Your job is to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks. Your team members are: WebSearchAgent: Searches for information DataAnalystAgent: Performs calculations You only plan and delegate tasks - you do not execute them yourself. When assigning tasks, use this format: 1. <agent> : <task> After all tasks are complete, summarize the findings and end with \"TERMINATE\". \"\"\", ) web_search_agent = AssistantAgent( \"WebSearchAgent\", description=\"An agent for searching information on the web.\", tools=[search_web_tool], model_client=model_client, system_message=\"\"\" You are a web search agent. Your only tool is search_tool - use it to find information. You make only one search call at a time. Once you have the results, you never do calculations based on them. \"\"\", ) data_analyst_agent = AssistantAgent( \"DataAnalystAgent\", description=\"An agent for performing calculations.\", model_client=model_client, tools=[percentage_change_tool], system_message=\"\"\" You are a data analyst. Given the tasks you have been assigned, you should analyze the data and provide results using the tools provided. If you have not seen the data, ask for it. \"\"\", ) Note By default, AssistantAgent returns the tool output as the response. If your tool does not return a well-formed string in natural language format, you may want to add a reflection step within the agent by setting reflect_on_tool_use=True when creating the agent. This will allow the agent to reflect on the tool output and provide a natural language response. Workflow# The task is received by the SelectorGroupChat which, based on agent descriptions, selects the most appropriate agent to handle the initial task (typically the Planning Agent). The Planning Agent analyzes the task and breaks it down into subtasks, assigning each to the most appropriate agent using the format: <agent> : <task> Based on the conversation context and agent descriptions, the SelectorGroupChat manager dynamically selects the next agent to handle their assigned subtask. The Web Search Agent performs searches one at a time, storing results in the shared conversation history. The Data Analyst processes the gathered information using available calculation tools when selected. The workflow continues with agents being dynamically selected until either: The Planning Agent determines all subtasks are complete and sends “TERMINATE” An alternative termination condition is met (e.g., a maximum number of messages) When defining your agents, make sure to include a helpful description since this is used to decide which agent to select next. Termination Conditions# Let’s use two termination conditions: TextMentionTermination to end the conversation when the Planning Agent sends “TERMINATE”, and MaxMessageTermination to limit the conversation to 25 messages to avoid infinite loop. text_mention_termination = TextMentionTermination(\"TERMINATE\") max_messages_termination = MaxMessageTermination(max_messages=25) termination = text_mention_termination | max_messages_termination Selector Prompt# SelectorGroupChat uses a model to select the next speaker based on the conversation context. We will use a custom selector prompt to properly align with the workflow. selector_prompt = \"\"\"Select an agent to perform task. {roles} Current conversation context: {history} Read the above conversation, then select an agent from {participants} to perform the next task. Make sure the planner agent has assigned tasks before other agents start working. Only select one agent. \"\"\" The string variables available in the selector prompt are: {participants}: The names of candidates for selection. The format is [\"<name1>\", \"<name2>\", ...]. {roles}: A newline-separated list of names and descriptions of the candidate agents. The format for each line is: \"<name> : <description>\". {history}: The conversation history formatted as a double newline separated of names and message content. The format for each message is: \"<name> : <message content>\". Tip Try not to overload the model with too much instruction in the selector prompt. What is too much? It depends on the capabilities of the model you are using. For GPT-4o and equivalents, you can use a selector prompt with a condition for when each speaker should be selected. For smaller models such as Phi-4, you should keep the selector prompt as simple as possible such as the one used in this example. Generally, if you find yourself writing multiple conditions for each agent, it is a sign that you should consider using a custom selection function, or breaking down the task into smaller, sequential tasks to be handled by separate agents or teams. Running the Team# Let’s create the team with the agents, termination conditions, and custom selector prompt. team = SelectorGroupChat( [planning_agent, web_search_agent, data_analyst_agent], model_client=model_client, termination_condition=termination, selector_prompt=selector_prompt, allow_repeated_speaker=True, # Allow an agent to speak multiple turns in a row. ) Now we run the team with a task to find information about an NBA player. task = \"Who was the Miami Heat player with the highest points in the 2006-2007 season, and what was the percentage change in his total rebounds between the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons?\" # Use asyncio.run(...) if you are running this in a script. await Console(team.run_stream(task=task)) ---------- user ---------- Who was the Miami Heat player with the highest points in the 2006-2007 season, and what was the percentage change in his total rebounds between the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons? ---------- PlanningAgent ---------- To complete this task, we need to perform the following subtasks: 1.

Using Reasoning Models# So far in the examples, we have used a gpt-4o model. Models like gpt-4o and gemini-1.5-flash are great at following instructions, so you can have relatively detailed instructions in the selector prompt for the team and the system messages for each agent to guide their behavior. However, if you are using a reasoning model like o3-mini, you will need to keep the selector prompt and system messages as simple and to the point as possible. This is because the reasoning models are already good at coming up with their own instructions given the context provided to them. This also means that we don’t need a planning agent to break down the task anymore, since the SelectorGroupChat that uses a reasoning model can do that on its own. In the following example, we will use o3-mini as the model for the agents and the team, and we will not use a planning agent. Also, we are keeping the selector prompt and system messages as simple as possible. model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"o3-mini\") web_search_agent = AssistantAgent( \"WebSearchAgent\", description=\"An agent for searching information on the web.\", tools=[search_web_tool], model_client=model_client, system_message=\"\"\"Use web search tool to find information.\"\"\", ) data_analyst_agent = AssistantAgent( \"DataAnalystAgent\", description=\"An agent for performing calculations.\", model_client=model_client, tools=[percentage_change_tool], system_message=\"\"\"Use tool to perform calculation.
