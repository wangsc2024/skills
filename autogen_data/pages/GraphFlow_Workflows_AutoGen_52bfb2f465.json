  "content": "In this section you’ll learn how to create an multi-agent workflow using GraphFlow, or simply “flow” for short. It uses structured execution and precisely controls how agents interact to accomplish a task.\n\nWe’ll first show you how to create and run a flow. We’ll then explain how to observe and debug flow behavior, and discuss important operations for managing execution.\n\nAutoGen AgentChat provides a team for directed graph execution:\n\nGraphFlow: A team that follows a DiGraph to control the execution flow between agents. Supports sequential, parallel, conditional, and looping behaviors.\n\nWhen should you use GraphFlow?\n\nUse Graph when you need strict control over the order in which agents act, or when different outcomes must lead to different next steps. Start with a simple team such as RoundRobinGroupChat or SelectorGroupChat if ad-hoc conversation flow is sufficient. Transition to a structured workflow when your task requires deterministic control, conditional branching, or handling complex multi-step processes with cycles.\n\nWarning: GraphFlow is an experimental feature. Its API, behavior, and capabilities are subject to change in future releases.\n\nDiGraphBuilder is a fluent utility that lets you easily construct execution graphs for workflows. It supports building:\n\nConditional branching\n\nLoops with safe exit conditions\n\nEach node in the graph represents an agent, and edges define the allowed execution paths. Edges can optionally have conditions based on agent messages.\n\nWe will begin by creating a simple workflow where a writer drafts a paragraph and a reviewer provides feedback. This graph terminates after the reviewer comments on the writer.\n\nNote, the flow automatically computes all the source and leaf nodes of the graph and the execution starts at all the source nodes in the graph and completes execution when no nodes are left to execute.\n\nWe now create a slightly more complex flow:\n\nA writer drafts a paragraph.\n\nTwo editors independently edit for grammar and style (parallel fan-out).\n\nA final reviewer consolidates their edits (join).\n\nExecution starts at the writer, fans out to editor1 and editor2 simultaneously, and then both feed into the final reviewer.\n\nIn GraphFlow, the execution graph is defined using DiGraph, which controls the order in which agents execute. However, the execution graph does not control what messages an agent receives from other agents. By default, all messages are sent to all agents in the graph.\n\nMessage filtering is a separate feature that allows you to filter the messages received by each agent and limiting their model context to only the relevant information. The set of message filters defines the message graph in the flow.\n\nSpecifying the message graph can help with:\n\nReduce hallucinations\n\nFocus agents only on relevant information\n\nYou can use MessageFilterAgent together with MessageFilterConfig and PerSourceFilter to define these rules.\n\nThis example demonstrates:\n\nA loop between generator and reviewer (which exits when reviewer says “APPROVE”)\n\nA summarizer agent that only sees the first user input and the last reviewer message\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to use activation_group and activation_condition to handle complex dependency patterns in cyclic graphs, especially when multiple paths lead to the same target node.\n\nIn this scenario, we have A → B → C → B, where B has two incoming edges (from A and from C). By default, B requires all its dependencies to be satisfied before executing.\n\nThis example shows a review loop where both the initial input (A) and the feedback (C) must be processed before B can execute again.\n\nIn this more complex scenario, we have A → B → (C1, C2) → B, where:\n\nB fans out to both C1 and C2 in parallel\n\nBoth C1 and C2 feed back to B\n\nB uses “any” activation, meaning it executes as soon as either C1 or C2 completes\n\nThis is useful for scenarios where you want the fastest response to trigger the next step.\n\nThis example shows how different activation groups can coexist in the same graph. We have a scenario where:\n\nNode D receives inputs from multiple sources with different activation requirements\n\nSome dependencies use “all” activation (must wait for all inputs)\n\nOther dependencies use “any” activation (proceed on first input)\n\nThis pattern is useful for complex workflows where different types of dependencies have different urgency levels.\n\nactivation_group: Groups edges that point to the same target node, allowing you to define different dependency patterns.\n\nactivation_condition:\n\n\"all\" (default): Target node waits for ALL edges in the group to be satisfied\n\n\"any\": Target node executes as soon as ANY edge in the group is satisfied\n\nCycles with multiple entry points: Different activation groups prevent conflicts\n\nPriority-based execution: Mix “all” and “any” conditions for different urgency levels\n\nParallel processing with early termination: Use “any” to proceed with the fastest result\n\nUse descriptive group names (\"critical\", \"optional\", \"feedback\", etc.)\n\nKeep activation conditions consistent within the same group\n\nTest your graph logic with different execution paths\n\nThese patterns enable sophisticated workflow control while maintaining clear, understandable execution semantics.",

      "description": "AgentChat GraphFlow (Workflows) GraphFlow (Workflows)# In this section you’ll learn how to create an multi-agent workflow using GraphFlow, or simply “flow” for short. It uses structured execution and precisely controls how agents interact to accomplish a task. We’ll first show you how to create and run a flow. We’ll then explain how to observe and debug flow behavior, and discuss important operations for managing execution. AutoGen AgentChat provides a team for directed graph execution: GraphFlow: A team that follows a DiGraph to control the execution flow between agents. Supports sequential, parallel, conditional, and looping behaviors. Note When should you use GraphFlow? Use Graph when you need strict control over the order in which agents act, or when different outcomes must lead to different next steps. Start with a simple team such as RoundRobinGroupChat or SelectorGroupChat if ad-hoc conversation flow is sufficient. Transition to a structured workflow when your task requires deterministic control, conditional branching, or handling complex multi-step processes with cycles. Warning: GraphFlow is an experimental feature. Its API, behavior, and capabilities are subject to change in future releases. Creating and Running a Flow# DiGraphBuilder is a fluent utility that lets you easily construct execution graphs for workflows. It supports building: Sequential chains Parallel fan-outs Conditional branching Loops with safe exit conditions Each node in the graph represents an agent, and edges define the allowed execution paths. Edges can optionally have conditions based on agent messages. Sequential Flow# We will begin by creating a simple workflow where a writer drafts a paragraph and a reviewer provides feedback. This graph terminates after the reviewer comments on the writer. Note, the flow automatically computes all the source and leaf nodes of the graph and the execution starts at all the source nodes in the graph and completes execution when no nodes are left to execute. from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent from autogen_agentchat.teams import DiGraphBuilder, GraphFlow from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient # Create an OpenAI model client client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"gpt-4.1-nano\") # Create the writer agent writer = AssistantAgent(\"writer\", model_client=client, system_message=\"Draft a short paragraph on climate change.\") # Create the reviewer agent reviewer = AssistantAgent(\"reviewer\", model_client=client, system_message=\"Review the draft and suggest improvements.\") # Build the graph builder = DiGraphBuilder() builder.add_node(writer).add_node(reviewer) builder.add_edge(writer, reviewer) # Build and validate the graph graph = builder.build() # Create the flow flow = GraphFlow([writer, reviewer], graph=graph) # Use `asyncio.run(...)` and wrap the below in a async function when running in a script. stream = flow.run_stream(task=\"Write a short paragraph about climate change.\") async for event in stream: # type: ignore print(event) # Use Console(flow.run_stream(...)) for better formatting in console. source='user' models_usage=None metadata={} content='Write a short paragraph about climate change.' type='TextMessage' source='writer' models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=28, completion_tokens=95) metadata={} content='Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric patterns, largely driven by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes.

We have a scenario where: Node D receives inputs from multiple sources with different activation requirements Some dependencies use “all” activation (must wait for all inputs) Other dependencies use “any” activation (proceed on first input) This pattern is useful for complex workflows where different types of dependencies have different urgency levels. # Create agents for mixed activation scenario agent_a3 = AssistantAgent(\"A\", model_client=client, system_message=\"Provide critical input that must be processed.\") agent_b3 = AssistantAgent(\"B\", model_client=client, system_message=\"Provide secondary critical input.\") agent_c3 = AssistantAgent(\"C\", model_client=client, system_message=\"Provide optional quick input.\") agent_d3 = AssistantAgent(\"D\", model_client=client, system_message=\"Process inputs based on different priority levels.\") # Build graph with mixed activation groups builder3 = DiGraphBuilder() builder3.add_node(agent_a3).add_node(agent_b3).add_node(agent_c3).add_node(agent_d3) # Critical inputs that must ALL be present (activation_group=\"critical\", activation_condition=\"all\") builder3.add_edge(agent_a3, agent_d3, activation_group=\"critical\", activation_condition=\"all\") builder3.add_edge(agent_b3, agent_d3, activation_group=\"critical\", activation_condition=\"all\") # Optional input that can trigger execution on its own (activation_group=\"optional\", activation_condition=\"any\") builder3.add_edge(agent_c3, agent_d3, activation_group=\"optional\", activation_condition=\"any\") # Build and create flow graph3 = builder3.build() flow3 = GraphFlow(participants=[agent_a3, agent_b3, agent_c3, agent_d3], graph=graph3) print(\"=== Example 3: Mixed Activation Groups ===\") print(\"D will execute when:\") print(\"- BOTH A AND B complete (critical group with 'all' activation), OR\") print(\"- C completes (optional group with 'any' activation)\") print(\"This allows for both required dependencies and fast-path triggers.\") # await Console(flow3.run_stream(task=\"Process inputs with mixed priority levels.\")) Key Takeaways for Activation Groups# activation_group: Groups edges that point to the same target node, allowing you to define different dependency patterns. activation_condition: \"all\" (default): Target node waits for ALL edges in the group to be satisfied \"any\": Target node executes as soon as ANY edge in the group is satisfied Use Cases: Cycles with multiple entry points: Different activation groups prevent conflicts Priority-based execution: Mix “all” and “any” conditions for different urgency levels Parallel processing with early termination: Use “any” to proceed with the fastest result Best Practices: Use descriptive group names (\"critical\", \"optional\", \"feedback\", etc.) Keep activation conditions consistent within the same group Test your graph logic with different execution paths These patterns enable sophisticated workflow control while maintaining clear, understandable execution semantics. previous Magentic-One next Memory and RAG On this page Creating and Running a Flow Sequential Flow Parallel Flow with Join Message Filtering Execution Graph vs. Message Graph 🔁 Advanced Example: Conditional Loop + Filtered Summary 🔁 Advanced Example: Cycles With Activation Group Examples Example 1: Loop with Multiple Paths - “All” Activation (A→B→C→B) Example 2: Loop with Multiple Paths - “Any” Activation (A→B→(C1,C2)→B) Example 3: Mixed Activation Groups Key Takeaways for Activation Groups Edit on GitHub Show Source",

      "description": "AgentChat GraphFlow (Workflows) GraphFlow (Workflows)# In this section you’ll learn how to create an multi-agent workflow using GraphFlow, or simply “flow” for short. It uses structured execution and precisely controls how agents interact to accomplish a task. We’ll first show you how to create and run a flow. We’ll then explain how to observe and debug flow behavior, and discuss important operations for managing execution. AutoGen AgentChat provides a team for directed graph execution: GraphFlow: A team that follows a DiGraph to control the execution flow between agents. Supports sequential, parallel, conditional, and looping behaviors. Note When should you use GraphFlow? Use Graph when you need strict control over the order in which agents act, or when different outcomes must lead to different next steps. Start with a simple team such as RoundRobinGroupChat or SelectorGroupChat if ad-hoc conversation flow is sufficient. Transition to a structured workflow when your task requires deterministic control, conditional branching, or handling complex multi-step processes with cycles. Warning: GraphFlow is an experimental feature. Its API, behavior, and capabilities are subject to change in future releases. Creating and Running a Flow# DiGraphBuilder is a fluent utility that lets you easily construct execution graphs for workflows. It supports building: Sequential chains Parallel fan-outs Conditional branching Loops with safe exit conditions Each node in the graph represents an agent, and edges define the allowed execution paths. Edges can optionally have conditions based on agent messages. Sequential Flow# We will begin by creating a simple workflow where a writer drafts a paragraph and a reviewer provides feedback. This graph terminates after the reviewer comments on the writer. Note, the flow automatically computes all the source and leaf nodes of the graph and the execution starts at all the source nodes in the graph and completes execution when no nodes are left to execute. from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent from autogen_agentchat.teams import DiGraphBuilder, GraphFlow from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient # Create an OpenAI model client client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"gpt-4.1-nano\") # Create the writer agent writer = AssistantAgent(\"writer\", model_client=client, system_message=\"Draft a short paragraph on climate change.\") # Create the reviewer agent reviewer = AssistantAgent(\"reviewer\", model_client=client, system_message=\"Review the draft and suggest improvements.\") # Build the graph builder = DiGraphBuilder() builder.add_node(writer).add_node(reviewer) builder.add_edge(writer, reviewer) # Build and validate the graph graph = builder.build() # Create the flow flow = GraphFlow([writer, reviewer], graph=graph) # Use `asyncio.run(...)` and wrap the below in a async function when running in a script. stream = flow.run_stream(task=\"Write a short paragraph about climate change.\") async for event in stream: # type: ignore print(event) # Use Console(flow.run_stream(...)) for better formatting in console. source='user' models_usage=None metadata={} content='Write a short paragraph about climate change.' type='TextMessage' source='writer' models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=28, completion_tokens=95) metadata={} content='Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric patterns, largely driven by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes.

Example 1: Loop with Multiple Paths - “All” Activation (A→B→C→B)# In this scenario, we have A → B → C → B, where B has two incoming edges (from A and from C). By default, B requires all its dependencies to be satisfied before executing. This example shows a review loop where both the initial input (A) and the feedback (C) must be processed before B can execute again. from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent from autogen_agentchat.teams import DiGraphBuilder, GraphFlow from autogen_agentchat.conditions import MaxMessageTermination from autogen_agentchat.ui import Console from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient # Model client client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\") # Create agents for A→B→C→B→E scenario agent_a = AssistantAgent(\"A\", model_client=client, system_message=\"Start the process and provide initial input.\") agent_b = AssistantAgent( \"B\", model_client=client, system_message=\"Process input from A or feedback from C.

Say 'C2_COMPLETE' when done.\") agent_e = AssistantAgent(\"E\", model_client=client, system_message=\"Finalize the process.\") # Build the graph with \"any\" activation builder2 = DiGraphBuilder() builder2.add_node(agent_a2).add_node(agent_b2).add_node(agent_c1).add_node(agent_c2).add_node(agent_e) # A → B (initial) builder2.add_edge(agent_a2, agent_b2) # B → C1 and B → C2 (parallel fan-out) builder2.add_edge(agent_b2, agent_c1, condition=\"PROCESS\") builder2.add_edge(agent_b2, agent_c2, condition=\"PROCESS\") # B → E (exit condition) builder2.add_edge(agent_b2, agent_e, condition=lambda msg: \"DONE\" in msg.to_model_text()) # C1 → B and C2 → B (both in same activation group with \"any\" condition) builder2.add_edge( agent_c1, agent_b2, activation_group=\"loop_back_group\", activation_condition=\"any\", condition=\"C1_COMPLETE\" ) builder2.add_edge( agent_c2, agent_b2, activation_group=\"loop_back_group\", activation_condition=\"any\", condition=\"C2_COMPLETE\" ) # Build and create flow graph2 = builder2.build() flow2 = GraphFlow(participants=[agent_a2, agent_b2, agent_c1, agent_c2, agent_e], graph=graph2) print(\"=== Example 2: A→B→(C1,C2)→B with 'Any' Activation ===\") print(\"B will execute as soon as EITHER C1 OR C2 completes (whichever finishes first)\") # await Console(flow2.run_stream(task=\"Start a parallel processing task.\")) Example 3: Mixed Activation Groups# This example shows how different activation groups can coexist in the same graph. We have a scenario where: Node D receives inputs from multiple sources with different activation requirements Some dependencies use “all” activation (must wait for all inputs) Other dependencies use “any” activation (proceed on first input) This pattern is useful for complex workflows where different types of dependencies have different urgency levels. # Create agents for mixed activation scenario agent_a3 = AssistantAgent(\"A\", model_client=client, system_message=\"Provide critical input that must be processed.\") agent_b3 = AssistantAgent(\"B\", model_client=client, system_message=\"Provide secondary critical input.\") agent_c3 = AssistantAgent(\"C\", model_client=client, system_message=\"Provide optional quick input.\") agent_d3 = AssistantAgent(\"D\", model_client=client, system_message=\"Process inputs based on different priority levels.\") # Build graph with mixed activation groups builder3 = DiGraphBuilder() builder3.add_node(agent_a3).add_node(agent_b3).add_node(agent_c3).add_node(agent_d3) # Critical inputs that must ALL be present (activation_group=\"critical\", activation_condition=\"all\") builder3.add_edge(agent_a3, agent_d3, activation_group=\"critical\", activation_condition=\"all\") builder3.add_edge(agent_b3, agent_d3, activation_group=\"critical\", activation_condition=\"all\") # Optional input that can trigger execution on its own (activation_group=\"optional\", activation_condition=\"any\") builder3.add_edge(agent_c3, agent_d3, activation_group=\"optional\", activation_condition=\"any\") # Build and create flow graph3 = builder3.build() flow3 = GraphFlow(participants=[agent_a3, agent_b3, agent_c3, agent_d3], graph=graph3) print(\"=== Example 3: Mixed Activation Groups ===\") print(\"D will execute when:\") print(\"- BOTH A AND B complete (critical group with 'all' activation), OR\") print(\"- C completes (optional group with 'any' activation)\") print(\"This allows for both required dependencies and fast-path triggers.\") # await Console(flow3.run_stream(task=\"Process inputs with mixed priority levels.\")) Key Takeaways for Activation Groups# activation_group: Groups edges that point to the same target node, allowing you to define different dependency patterns. activation_condition: \"all\" (default): Target node waits for ALL edges in the group to be satisfied \"any\": Target node executes as soon as ANY edge in the group is satisfied Use Cases: Cycles with multiple entry points: Different activation groups prevent conflicts Priority-based execution: Mix “all” and “any” conditions for different urgency levels Parallel processing with early termination: Use “any” to proceed with the fastest result Best Practices: Use descriptive group names (\"critical\", \"optional\", \"feedback\", etc.) Keep activation conditions consistent within the same group Test your graph logic with different execution paths These patterns enable sophisticated workflow control while maintaining clear, understandable execution semantics. previous Magentic-One next Memory and RAG",
