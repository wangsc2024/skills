  "content": "Swarm implements a team in which agents can hand off task to other agents based on their capabilities. It is a multi-agent design pattern first introduced by OpenAI in Swarm. The key idea is to let agent delegate tasks to other agents using a special tool call, while all agents share the same message context. This enables agents to make local decisions about task planning, rather than relying on a central orchestrator such as in SelectorGroupChat.\n\nSwarm is a high-level API. If you need more control and customization that is not supported by this API, you can take a look at the Handoff Pattern in the Core API documentation and implement your own version of the Swarm pattern.\n\nAt its core, the Swarm team is a group chat where agents take turn to generate a response. Similar to SelectorGroupChat and RoundRobinGroupChat, participant agents broadcast their responses so all agents share the same message context.\n\nDifferent from the other two group chat teams, at each turn, the speaker agent is selected based on the most recent HandoffMessage message in the context. This naturally requires each agent in the team to be able to generate HandoffMessage to signal which other agents that it hands off to.\n\nFor AssistantAgent, you can set the handoffs argument to specify which agents it can hand off to. You can use Handoff to customize the message content and handoff behavior.\n\nThe overall process can be summarized as follows:\n\nEach agent has the ability to generate HandoffMessage to signal which other agents it can hand off to. For AssistantAgent, this means setting the handoffs argument.\n\nWhen the team starts on a task, the first speaker agents operate on the task and make localized decision about whether to hand off and to whom.\n\nWhen an agent generates a HandoffMessage, the receiving agent takes over the task with the same message context.\n\nThe process continues until a termination condition is met.\n\nThe AssistantAgent uses the tool calling capability of the model to generate handoffs. This means that the model must support tool calling. If the model does parallel tool calling, multiple handoffs may be generated at the same time. This can lead to unexpected behavior. To avoid this, you can disable parallel tool calling by configuring the model client. For OpenAIChatCompletionClient and AzureOpenAIChatCompletionClient, you can set parallel_tool_calls=False in the configuration.\n\nIn this section, we will show you two examples of how to use the Swarm team:\n\nA customer support team with human-in-the-loop handoff.\n\nAn automonous team for content generation.\n\nThis system implements a flights refund scenario with two agents:\n\nTravel Agent: Handles general travel and refund coordination.\n\nFlights Refunder: Specializes in processing flight refunds with the refund_flight tool.\n\nAdditionally, we let the user interact with the agents, when agents handoff to \"user\".\n\nThe Travel Agent initiates the conversation and evaluates the user’s request.\n\nBased on the request:\n\nFor refund-related tasks, the Travel Agent hands off to the Flights Refunder.\n\nFor information needed from the customer, either agent can hand off to the \"user\".\n\nThe Flights Refunder processes refunds using the refund_flight tool when appropriate.\n\nIf an agent hands off to the \"user\", the team execution will stop and wait for the user to input a response.\n\nWhen the user provides input, it’s sent back to the team as a HandoffMessage. This message is directed to the agent that originally requested user input.\n\nThe process continues until the Travel Agent determines the task is complete and terminates the workflow.\n\nThis system is designed to perform stock research tasks by leveraging four agents:\n\nPlanner: The central coordinator that delegates specific tasks to specialized agents based on their expertise. The planner ensures that each agent is utilized efficiently and oversees the overall workflow.\n\nFinancial Analyst: A specialized agent responsible for analyzing financial metrics and stock data using tools such as get_stock_data.\n\nNews Analyst: An agent focused on gathering and summarizing recent news articles relevant to the stock, using tools such as get_news.\n\nWriter: An agent tasked with compiling the findings from the stock and news analysis into a cohesive final report.\n\nThe Planner initiates the research process by delegating tasks to the appropriate agents in a step-by-step manner.\n\nEach agent performs its task independently and appends their work to the shared message thread/history. Rather than directly returning results to the planner, all agents contribute to and read from this shared message history. When agents generate their work using the LLM, they have access to this shared message history, which provides context and helps track the overall progress of the task.\n\nOnce an agent completes its task, it hands off control back to the planner.\n\nThe process continues until the planner determines that all necessary tasks have been completed and decides to terminate the workflow.",
