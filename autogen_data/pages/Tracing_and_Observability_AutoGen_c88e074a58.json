  "title": "Tracing and Observability — AutoGen",
  "content": "AutoGen has built-in support for tracing and observability for collecting comprehensive records on the execution of your application. This feature is useful for debugging, performance analysis, and understanding the flow of your application.\n\nThis capability is powered by the OpenTelemetry library, which means you can use any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend to collect and analyze traces.\n\nAutoGen follows the OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for tracing, for agents and tools. It also follows the Semantic Conventions for GenAI Systems currently under development.\n\nTo begin, you need to install the OpenTelemetry Python package. You can do this using pip:\n\nOnce you have the SDK installed, the simplest way to set up tracing in AutoGen is to:\n\nConfigure an OpenTelemetry tracer provider\n\nSet up an exporter to send traces to your backend\n\nConnect the tracer provider to the AutoGen runtime\n\nTo collect and view traces, you need to set up a telemetry backend. Several open-source options are available, including Jaeger, Zipkin. For this example, we will use Jaeger as our telemetry backend.\n\nFor a quick start, you can run Jaeger locally using Docker:\n\nThis command starts a Jaeger instance that listens on port 16686 for the Jaeger UI and port 4317 for the OpenTelemetry collector. You can access the Jaeger UI at http://localhost:16686.\n\nIn the following section, we will review how to enable tracing with an AutoGen GroupChat team. The AutoGen runtime already supports open telemetry (automatically logging message metadata). To begin, we will create a tracing service that will be used to instrument the AutoGen runtime.\n\nAll of the code to create a team should already be familiar to you.\n\nAgentChat teams are run using the AutoGen Core’s agent runtime. In turn, the runtime is already instrumented to log, see Core Telemetry Guide. To disable the agent runtime telemetry, you can set the trace_provider to opentelemetry.trace.NoOpTracerProvider in the runtime constructor.\n\nAdditionally, you can set the environment variable AUTOGEN_DISABLE_RUNTIME_TRACING to true to disable the agent runtime telemetry if you don’t have access to the runtime constructor. For example, if you are using ComponentConfig.\n\nYou can then use the Jaeger UI to view the traces collected from the application run above.\n\nSerializing Components",
