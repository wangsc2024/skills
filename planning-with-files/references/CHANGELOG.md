# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed

- **Template Files Not Found in Cache** (Fixes #18)
  - Root cause: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to repo root, but templates were only in subfolders
  - Added `templates/` and `scripts/` directories at repo root level
  - Now templates are accessible regardless of how `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` resolves
  - Works for both plugin installs and manual installs

### Structure

After this fix, templates exist in THREE locations for maximum compatibility:
- `templates/` - At repo root (for `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/`)
- `planning-with-files/templates/` - For plugin marketplace installs
- `skills/planning-with-files/templates/` - For legacy `~/.claude/skills/` installs

### Workaround for Existing Users

If you still experience issues after updating:
1. Uninstall: `/plugin uninstall planning-with-files@planning-with-files`
2. Reinstall: `/plugin marketplace add OthmanAdi/planning-with-files`
3. Install: `/plugin install planning-with-files@planning-with-files`
