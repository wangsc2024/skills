# Planning with Files

> **Work like Manus** — the AI agent company Meta acquired for **$2 billion**.

## Thank You

To everyone who starred, forked, and shared this skill — thank you. This project blew up in less than 24 hours, and the support from the community has been incredible.

If this skill helps you work smarter, that's all I wanted.

A Claude Code plugin that transforms your workflow to use persistent markdown files for planning, progress tracking, and knowledge storage — the exact pattern that made Manus worth billions.

## Why This Skill?

On December 29, 2025, [Meta acquired Manus for $2 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/29/meta-just-bought-manus-an-ai-startup-everyone-has-been-talking-about/). In just 8 months, Manus went from launch to $100M+ revenue. Their secret? **Context engineering**.

> "Markdown is my 'working memory' on disk. Since I process information iteratively and my active context has limits, Markdown files serve as scratch pads for notes, checkpoints for progress, building blocks for final deliverables."
> — Manus AI

## The Problem

Claude Code (and most AI agents) suffer from:

- **Volatile memory** — TodoWrite tool disappears on context reset
- **Goal drift** — After 50+ tool calls, original goals get forgotten
- **Hidden errors** — Failures aren't tracked, so the same mistakes repeat
- **Context stuffing** — Everything crammed into context instead of stored

## The Solution: 3-File Pattern

For every complex task, create THREE files:

```
task_plan.md      → Track phases and progress
findings.md       → Store research and findings
progress.md       → Session log and test results
```

### The Core Principle

```
Context Window = RAM (volatile, limited)
Filesystem = Disk (persistent, unlimited)

→ Anything important gets written to disk.
```

## Usage

Once installed, Claude will automatically:

1. **Create `task_plan.md`** before starting complex tasks
2. **Re-read plan** before major decisions (via PreToolUse hook)
3. **Remind you** to update status after file writes (via PostToolUse hook)
4. **Store findings** in `findings.md` instead of stuffing context
5. **Log errors** for future reference
6. **Verify completion** before stopping (via Stop hook)

Or invoke manually with `/planning-with-files`.

See [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md) for the full 5-step guide.

## Key Rules

1. **Create Plan First** — Never start without `task_plan.md`
2. **The 2-Action Rule** — Save findings after every 2 view/browser operations
3. **Log ALL Errors** — They help avoid repetition
4. **Never Repeat Failures** — Track attempts, mutate approach

## The Manus Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Filesystem as memory | Store in files, not context |
| Attention manipulation | Re-read plan before decisions (hooks) |
| Error persistence | Log failures in plan file |
| Goal tracking | Checkboxes show progress |
| Completion verification | Stop hook checks all phases |

## When to Use

**Use this pattern for:**
- Multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
- Research tasks
- Building/creating projects
- Tasks spanning many tool calls

**Skip for:**
- Simple questions
- Single-file edits
- Quick lookups
