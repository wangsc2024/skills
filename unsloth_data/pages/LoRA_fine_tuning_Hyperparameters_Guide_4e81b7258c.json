Overfitting occurs when the model memorizes the training data, harming its ability to generalize to new, unseen inputs. The objective is a model that generalizes well, not one that simply memorizes.\n\n{% columns %}\n{% column %}\n\n#### :question:But what is LoRA?\n\nIn LLMs, we have model weights. Llama 70B has 70 billion numbers. Instead of changing all 70b numbers, we instead add thin matrices A and B to each weight, and optimize those. This means we only optimize 1% of weights.\n{% endcolumn %}\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://3215535692-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FxhOjnexMCB3dmuQFQ2Zq%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-715b6260aae497f160d7f9a1019bcfa472675dcf%2Fimage%20(7)%20(1)%20(1).png?alt=media\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><p>Instead of optimizing Model Weights (yellow), we optimize 2 thin matrices A and B.</p></figcaption></figure>\n{% endcolumn %}\n{% endcolumns %}\n\n## :1234: Key Fine-tuning Hyperparameters\n\n### **Learning Rate**\n\nDefines how much the model’s weights are adjusted during each training step.\n\n* **Higher Learning Rates**: Lead to faster initial convergence but can cause training to become unstable or fail to find an optimal minimum if set too high.\n* **Lower Learning Rates**: Result in more stable and precise training but may require more epochs to converge, increasing overall training time. While low learning rates are often thought to cause underfitting, they actually can lead to **overfitting** or even prevent the model from learning.\n* **Typical Range**: `2e-4` (0.0002) to `5e-6` (0.000005).\\\n  :green\\_square: ***For normal LoRA/QLoRA Fine-tuning***, *we recommend* **`2e-4`** *as a starting point.*\\\n  :blue\\_square: ***For Reinforcement Learning** (DPO, GRPO etc.), we recommend* **`5e-6` .**\\\n  :white\\_large\\_square: ***For Full Fine-tuning,** lower learning rates are generally more appropriate.*\n\nThe number of times the model sees the full training dataset.\n\n* **More Epochs:** Can help the model learn better, but a high number can cause it to **memorize the training data**, hurting its performance on new tasks.\n* **Fewer Epochs:** Reduces training time and can prevent overfitting, but may result in an undertrained model if the number is insufficient for the model to learn the dataset's underlying patterns.\n* **Recommended:** 1-3 epochs. For most instruction-based datasets, training for more than 3 epochs offers diminishing returns and increases the risk of overfitting.\n\n### **LoRA or QLoRA**\n\nLoRA uses 16-bit precision, while QLoRA is a 4-bit fine-tuning method.\n\n* **LoRA:** 16-bit fine-tuning. It's slightly faster and slightly more accurate, but consumes significantly more VRAM (4× more than QLoRA). Recommended for 16-bit environments and scenarios where maximum accuracy is required.\n* **QLoRA:** 4-bit fine-tuning. Slightly slower and marginally less accurate, but uses much less VRAM (4× less).\\\n  :sloth: *70B LLaMA fits in <48GB VRAM with QLoRA in Unsloth -* [*more details here*](https://unsloth.ai/blog/llama3-3)*.*\n\n### Hyperparameters & Recommendations:\n\n<table><thead><tr><th width=\"154.39678955078125\">Hyperparameter</th><th width=\"383.6192626953125\">Function</th><th>Recommended Settings</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>LoRA Rank</strong> (<code>r</code>)</td><td>Controls the number of trainable parameters in the LoRA adapter matrices.

This is managed by two parameters whose product is the **Effective Batch Size**.\\\n\\\n**Effective Batch Size** = `batch_size * gradient_accumulation_steps`\n\n* A **larger Effective Batch Size** generally leads to smoother, more stable training.\n* A **smaller Effective Batch Size** may introduce more variance.\n\nWhile every task is different, the following configuration provides a great starting point for achieving a stable **Effective Batch Size** of 16, which works well for most fine-tuning tasks on modern GPUs.\n\n| Parameter                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Recommended Setting                             |\n| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| **Batch Size** (`batch_size`)                             | <p>The number of samples processed in a single forward/backward pass on one GPU.<br><br><strong>Primary Driver of VRAM Usage</strong>.

Then you can use any of the following configurations:\n\n* `batch_size = 32, gradient_accumulation_steps = 1`\n* `batch_size = 16, gradient_accumulation_steps = 2`\n* `batch_size = 8, gradient_accumulation_steps = 4`\n* `batch_size = 4, gradient_accumulation_steps = 8`\n* `batch_size = 2, gradient_accumulation_steps = 16`\n* `batch_size = 1, gradient_accumulation_steps = 32`\n\nWhile all of these are equivalent for the model's weight updates, they have vastly different hardware requirements.\n\nThe first configuration (`batch_size = 32`) uses the **most VRAM** and will likely fail on most GPUs. The last configuration (`batch_size = 1`) uses the **least VRAM,** but at the cost of slightly slower trainin&#x67;**.** To avoid OOM (out of memory) errors, always prefer to set a smaller `batch_size` and increase `gradient_accumulation_steps` to reach your target **Effective Batch Size**.\n\n### :sloth: Unsloth Gradient Accumulation Fix\n\nGradient accumulation and batch sizes <mark style=\"color:green;\">**are now fully equivalent in Unsloth**</mark> due to our bug fixes for gradient accumulation. We have implemented specific bug fixes for gradient accumulation that resolve a common issue where the two methods did not produce the same results. This was a known challenge in the wider community, but for Unsloth users, the two methods are now interchangeable.\n\n[Read our blog post](https://unsloth.ai/blog/gradient) for more details.\n\nPrior to our fixes, combinations of `batch_size` and `gradient_accumulation_steps` that yielded the same **Effective Batch Size** (i.e., `batch_size × gradient_accumulation_steps = 16`) did not result in equivalent training behavior. For example, configurations like `b1/g16`, `b2/g8`, `b4/g4`, `b8/g2`, and `b16/g1` all have an **Effective Batch Size** of 16, but as shown in the graph, the loss curves did not align when using standard gradient accumulation:\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://3215535692-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FxhOjnexMCB3dmuQFQ2Zq%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-66eb907fd9ce38ab29dacef82794d0525057aeb4%2FBefore_-_Standard_gradient_accumulation_UQOFkUggudXuV9dzrh8MA.svg?alt=media\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><p>(Before - Standard Gradient Accumulation)</p></figcaption></figure>\n\nAfter applying our fixes, the loss curves now align correctly, regardless of how the **Effective Batch Size** of 16 is achieved:\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://3215535692-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FxhOjnexMCB3dmuQFQ2Zq%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-61f7c60412a2a39584f75cce5dca41e3e35eb7f2%2FAfter_-_Unsloth_gradient_accumulation_6Y4pJdJF0vruzradUpymY.svg?alt=media\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><p>(After - 🦥 <mark style=\"color:green;\">Unsloth Gradient Accumulation</mark>)</p></figcaption></figure>\n\n## 🦥 **LoRA Hyperparameters in Unsloth**\n\nThe following demonstrates a standard configuration. **While Unsloth provides optimized defaults**, understanding these parameters is key to manual tuning.\n\n<div data-full-width=\"false\"><figure><img src=\"https://3215535692-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FxhOjnexMCB3dmuQFQ2Zq%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-9843f8cc26aac6445236250f5c32394186eace59%2Fnotebook_parameter_screenshott.png?alt=media\" alt=\"\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\nThe rank (`r`) of the fine-tuning process. A larger rank uses more memory and will be slower, but can increase accuracy on complex tasks. We suggest ranks like 8 or 16 (for fast fine-tunes) and up to 128. Using a rank that is too large can cause overfitting and harm your model's quality.\\\\\n2.\n\nFor optimal performance, <mark style=\"background-color:blue;\">**LoRA should be applied to all major linear layers**</mark>. [Research has shown](#lora-target-modules-and-qlora-vs-lora) that targeting all major layers is crucial for matching the performance of full fine-tuning. While it's possible to remove modules to reduce memory usage, we strongly advise against it to preserve maximum quality as the savings are minimal.\\\\\n3.\n\nA scaling factor that controls the strength of the fine-tuned adjustments. Setting it equal to the rank (`r`) is a reliable baseline. A popular and effective heuristic is to set it to double the rank (`r * 2`), which makes the model learn more aggressively by giving more weight to the LoRA updates. [More details here](#lora-alpha-and-rank-relationship).\\\\\n4.\n\nA regularization technique that helps [prevent overfitting](#overfitting-poor-generalization-too-specialized) by randomly setting a fraction of the LoRA activations to zero during each training step. [Recent research suggests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09692) that for **the short training runs** common in fine-tuning, `lora_dropout` may be an unreliable regularizer.\\\n   🦥 *Unsloth's internal code can optimize training when* `lora_dropout = 0`*, making it slightly faster, but we recommend a non-zero value if you suspect overfitting.*\\\\\n5.\n\nLeave this as `\"none\"` for faster training and reduced memory usage. This setting avoids training the bias terms in the linear layers, which adds trainable parameters for little to no practical gain.\\\\\n6.\n\nOptions are `True`, `False`, and `\"unsloth\"`.\\\n   🦥 *We recommend* `\"unsloth\"` *as it reduces memory usage by an extra 30% and supports extremely long context fine-tunes. You can read more on* [*our blog post about long context training*](https://unsloth.ai/blog/long-context)*.*\\\\\n7.\n\nThe seed to ensure deterministic, reproducible runs. Training involves random numbers, so setting a fixed seed is essential for consistent experiments.\\\\\n8.\n\nAn advanced feature that implements [**Rank-Stabilized LoRA**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03732). If set to `True`, the effective scaling becomes `lora_alpha / sqrt(r)` instead of the standard `lora_alpha / r`. This can sometimes improve stability, particularly for higher ranks. [More details here](#lora-alpha-and-rank-relationship).\\\\\n9.\n\nAn advanced technique, as proposed in [**LoftQ**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08659), initializes LoRA matrices with the top 'r' singular vectors from the pretrained weights. This can improve accuracy but may cause a significant memory spike at the start of training.\n\n### **Verifying LoRA Weight Updates:**\n\nWhen validating that **LoRA** adapter weights have been updated after fine-tuning, avoid using **np.allclose()** for comparison. This method can miss subtle but meaningful changes, particularly in **LoRA A**, which is initialized with small Gaussian values. These changes may not register as significant under loose numerical tolerances. Thanks to [contributors](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/issues/3035) for this section.\n\nTo reliably confirm weight updates, we recommend:\n\n* Using **checksum or hash comparisons** (e.g., MD5)\n* Computing the **sum of absolute differences** between tensors\n* Inspecting t**ensor statistics** (e.g., mean, variance) manually\n* Or using **np.array\\_equal()** if exact equality is expected\n\n## :triangular\\_ruler:LoRA Alpha and Rank relationship\n\n{% hint style=\"success\" %}\nIt's best to set `lora_alpha = 2 * lora_rank` or `lora_alpha = lora_rank`\n{% endhint %}\n\n{% columns %}\n{% column width=\"50%\" %}\n$$\n\\hat{W} = W + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\text{rank}} \\times AB\n$$\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://3215535692-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FxhOjnexMCB3dmuQFQ2Zq%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-8e4f60c002f22e8ca9c534b48323e9e77e4b5ea6%2Fimage.png?alt=media\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><p>rsLoRA other scaling options. sqrt(r) is the best.</p></figcaption></figure>\n\n$$\n\\hat{W}\\_{\\text{rslora}} = W + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{\\text{rank}}} \\times AB\n$$\n{% endcolumn %}\n\n{% column %}\nThe formula for LoRA is on the left.

This effectively scales down the impact of fine-tuning.\n\n**This is closely related to merging / averaging weights.**\\\nYou can take the original base (or instruct) model, add the LoRA weights, then divide the result by 2. This gives you an averaged model — which is functionally equivalent to reducing the `alpha` by half.\n{% endhint %}\n\n* **Adjust the learning rate:** A high learning rate often leads to overfitting, especially during short training runs. For longer training, a higher learning rate may work better. It’s best to experiment with both to see which performs best.\n* **Reduce the number of training epochs**. Stop training after 1, 2, or 3 epochs.\n* **Increase** `weight_decay`. A value of `0.01` or `0.1` is a good starting point.\n* **Increase** `lora_dropout`. Use a value like `0.1` to add regularization.\n* **Increase batch size or gradient accumulation steps**.\n* **Dataset expansion** - make your dataset larger by combining or concatenating open source datasets with your dataset. Choose higher quality ones.\n* **Evaluation early stopping** - enable evaluation and stop when the evaluation loss increases for a few steps.\n* **LoRA Alpha Scaling** - scale the alpha down after training and during inference - this will make the finetune less pronounced.\n* **Weight averaging** - literally add the original instruct model and the finetune and divide the weights by 2.\n\n### **Underfitting** (Too Generic)\n\nThe model fails to capture the underlying patterns in the training data, often due to insufficient complexity or training duration.\n\n* **Adjust the Learning Rate:** If the current rate is too low, increasing it may speed up convergence, especially for short training runs. For longer runs, try lowering the learning rate instead. Test both approaches to see which works best.\n* **Increase Training Epochs:** Train for more epochs, but monitor validation loss to avoid overfitting.\n* **Increase LoRA Rank** (`r`) and alpha: Rank should at least equal to the alpha number, and rank should be bigger for smaller models/more complex datasets; it usually is between 4 and 64.\n* **Use a More Domain-Relevant Dataset**: Ensure the training data is high-quality and directly relevant to the target task.\n* **Decrease batch size to 1**. This will cause the model to update more vigorously.\n\n{% hint style=\"success\" %}\nFine-tuning has no single \"best\" approach, only best practices.
