## JigsawStack 🧩

<br />

[JigsawStack](https://jigsawstack.com/) is a powerful AI SDK designed to integrate into any backend, automating tasks such as web scraping, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), translation, and more, using 
Large Language Models (LLMs). By plugging JigsawStack into your existing application infrastructure, you can offload the heavy lifting and focus on building.

The [JigsawStack Prompt Engine]() is a feature that allows you to not only leverage LLMs but automatically choose the best LLM for every one of your prompts, delivering fast inference speed and performance
powered by Groq with features including:

- **Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) Approach:** Automatically selects optimized LLMs for your task, combining outputs for higher quality and faster results.
- **Prompt Caching:** Optimizes performance for repeated prompt runs.
- **Automatic Prompt Optimization:** Improves performance without manual intervention.
- **Response Schema Validation:** Ensures accuracy and consistency in outputs.

The Propt Engine also comes with a built-in prompt guard feature via Llama Guard 3 powered by Groq, which helps prevent prompt injection and a wide range of unsafe categories when activated, such as:
- Privacy Protection
- Hate Speech Filtering
- Sexual Content Blocking
- Election Misinformation Prevention
- Code Interpreter Abuse Protection
- Unauthorized Professional Advice Prevention

<br />

To get started, refer to the JigsawStack documentation [here](https://docs.jigsawstack.com/integration/groq) and learn how to set up your Prompt 
Engine [here](https://github.com/groq/groq-api-cookbook/tree/main/tutorials/jigsawstack-prompt-engine).

## Rate Limits

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/rate-limits

# Rate Limits
Rate limits act as control measures to regulate how frequently users and applications can access our API within specified timeframes. These limits help ensure service stability, fair access, and protection
against misuse so that we can serve reliable and fast inference for all.

## Understanding Rate Limits
Rate limits are measured in:
- **RPM:** Requests per minute
- **RPD:** Requests per day
- **TPM:** Tokens per minute
- **TPD:** Tokens per day
- **ASH:** Audio seconds per hour
- **ASD:** Audio seconds per day

Cached tokens do not count towards your rate limits.

Rate limits apply at the organization level, not individual users. You can hit any limit type depending on which threshold you reach first.

**Example:** Let's say your RPM = 50 and your TPM = 200K. If you were to send 50 requests with only 100 tokens within a minute, you would reach your limit even though you did not send 200K tokens within those
50 requests.

## Rate Limits
The following is a high level summary and there may be  exceptions to these limits. You can view the current, exact rate limits for your organization on the [limits page](/settings/limits) in your account settings.

## Rate Limit Headers
In addition to viewing your limits on your account's [limits](https://console.groq.com/settings/limits) page, you can also view rate limit information such as remaining requests and tokens in HTTP response 
headers as follows:

The following headers are set (values are illustrative):

## Handling Rate Limits
When you exceed rate limits, our API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP status code.

**Note**: `retry-after` is only set if you hit the rate limit and status code 429 is returned. The other headers are always included.

## Need Higher Rate Limits?
If you need higher rate limits, you can [request them here](https://groq.com/self-serve-support).

## Wolfram‑Alpha Integration

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/wolfram-alpha

# Wolfram‑Alpha Integration

Some models and systems on Groq have native support for Wolfram‑Alpha integration, allowing them to access Wolfram's computational knowledge engine for mathematical, scientific, and engineering computations. This tool enables models to solve complex problems that require precise calculation and access to structured knowledge.

## Supported Models

Wolfram‑Alpha integration is supported for the following models and systems (on [versions](/docs/compound#system-versioning) later than `2025-07-23`):

| Model ID                        | Model                          |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| groq/compound                   | [Compound](/docs/compound/systems/compound)
| groq/compound-mini              | [Compound Mini](/docs/compound/systems/compound-mini)

<br />

For a comparison between the `groq/compound` and `groq/compound-mini` systems and more information regarding extra capabilities, see the [Compound Systems](/docs/compound/systems#system-comparison) page.

## Quick Start

To use Wolfram‑Alpha integration, you must provide your own [Wolfram‑Alpha API key](#getting-your-wolframalpha-api-key) in the `wolfram_settings` configuration. The examples below show how to access all parts of the response: the final content, reasoning process, and tool execution details.

*These examples show how to access the complete response structure to understand the Wolfram‑Alpha computation process.*

<br />

When the API is called with a mathematical or scientific query, it will automatically use Wolfram‑Alpha to compute precise results. The response includes three key components:
- **Content**: The final synthesized response from the model with computational results
- **Reasoning**: The internal decision-making process showing the Wolfram‑Alpha query
- **Executed Tools**: Detailed information about the computation that was performed

## How It Works

When you ask a computational question:

1. **Query Analysis**: The system analyzes your question to determine if Wolfram‑Alpha computation is needed
2. **Wolfram‑Alpha Query**: The tool sends a structured query to Wolfram‑Alpha's computational engine  
3. **Result Processing**: The computational results are processed and made available to the model
4. **Response Generation**: The model uses both your query and the computational results to generate a comprehensive response

### Final Output

This is the final response from the model, containing the computational results and analysis. The model can provide step-by-step solutions, explanations, and contextual information about the mathematical or scientific computation.

<br />

**Multiplication**

To find \\(1293392 \\times 29393\\) we simply multiply the two integers.

Using a reliable computational tool (Wolfram|Alpha) gives:

\\[
1293392 \\times 29393 = 38{,}016{,}671{,}056
\\]

**Result**

\\[
\\boxed{38{,}016{,}671{,}056}
\\]

*Additional details from the computation*

- Scientific notation: \\(3.8016671056 \\times 10^{10}\\)  
- Number name: **38 billion 16 million 671 thousand 56**  
- The result has 11 decimal digits.  

Thus, the product of 1,293,392 and 29,393 is **38,016,671,056**.

### Reasoning and Internal Tool Calls

This shows the model's internal reasoning process and the Wolfram‑Alpha computation it executed to solve the problem. You can inspect this to understand how the model approached the problem and what specific query it sent to Wolfram‑Alpha.

<br />


To solve this problem, I will multiply 1293392 by 29393.


<output>Query:
"1293392*29393"

Input:
1293392×29393

Result:
38016671056

Scientific notation:
3.8016671056 × 10^10

Number line:
image: https://public6.wolframalpha.com/files/PNG_9r6zdhh0lo.png
Wolfram Language code: NumberLinePlot[38016671056]

Number name:
38 billion 16 million 671 thousand 56

Number length:
11 decimal digits

Comparisons:
≈ 0.13 × the number of stars in our galaxy (≈ 3×10^11)

≈ 0.35 × the number of people who have ever lived (≈ 1.1×10^11)

≈ 4.8 × the number of people alive today (≈ 7.8×10^9)

Wolfram|Alpha website result for "1293392*29393":
https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=1293392%2A29393</output>
Based on these results, I can see that 1293392*29393 equals 38016671056.

The final answer is 38016671056.

## Model Permissions

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/model-permissions

# Model Permissions

Limit which models can be used at the organization and project level. When a request attempts to use a restricted model, the API returns a 403 error.

## How It Works

Configure model permissions using either **"Only Allow"** or **"Only Block"** strategies:

### Only Allow

When you only allow specific models, all other models are blocked.

**Example:** Only allow `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` and `llama-3.1-8b-instant` → all other models are blocked.

### Only Block

When you only block specific models, all other models remain available.

**Example:** Only block `openai/gpt-oss-120b` → all other models remain available.

## Organization and Project Level Permissions

You can configure model permissions on either your organization, project, or both. These permissions cascade from the organization to the project, meaning that the project can only configure model permissions within the models which are allowed by the organization-level permissions.

### Organization Level Permissions

Members of the organization with the **Owner** role can configure model permissions at the organization level.

### Project Level Permissions

Members of the organization with either the **Developer** or **Owner** role can configure model permissions at the project level.

### Cascading Permissions

Permissions cascade from organization to project level. Organization settings always take precedence.

**How it works:**

1. **Organization Check First:** The system checks if the model is allowed at the org level
   - If blocked at org level → request rejected
   - If allowed at org level → proceed to project check

2. **Project Check Second:** The system checks if the model is allowed at the project level
   - If blocked at project level → request rejected
   - If allowed at project level → request proceeds

**Key point:** Projects can only work with models that are available after org-level filtering. They can only allow a subset of what the org allows, or block a subset of what the org allows. A model blocked at the org level cannot be enabled at the project level.

## Configuring Model Permissions

### At the Organization Level

1. Go to [**Settings** → **Organization** → **Limits**](/settings/limits)
2. Choose **Only Allow** or **Only Block**
3. Select which models to allow or block
4. Click **Save**

### At the Project Level

1. Select your project from the project selector
2. Go to [**Settings** → **Projects** → **Limits**](/settings/project/limits)
3. Choose **Only Allow** or **Only Block**
4. Select which models to allow or block
   - **Only Allow:** Choose from models available after org-level filtering
   - **Only Block:** Choose from models available after org-level filtering
5. Click **Save**

## Error Responses

Requests to restricted models return a 403 error with specific error codes depending on where the block occurred.

### Organization-Level Block

When a model is blocked at the organization level:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "The model `openai/gpt-oss-120b` is blocked at the organization level. Please have the org admin enable this model in the org settings at https://console.groq.com/settings/limits",
    "type": "permissions_error",
    "code": "model_permission_blocked_org"
  }
}
```

### Project-Level Block

When a model is blocked at the project level:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "The model `openai/gpt-oss-120b` is blocked at the project level. Please have a project admin enable this model in the project settings at https://console.groq.com/settings/project/limits",
    "type": "permissions_error",
    "code": "model_permission_blocked_project"
  }
}
```

## Common Use Cases

- **Compliance:** Restrict models that don't meet your data handling requirements
- **Cost Control:** Limit access to higher-cost models for specific teams
- **Environment Isolation:** Different model access for dev, staging, and production
- **Team Access:** Give teams access to specific models based on their needs

## Examples

**Scenario 1: Org permissions only**
- **Org:** Only Allow `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, `openai/gpt-oss-120b`
- **Project:** No restrictions

**Result:** Project can use `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, `openai/gpt-oss-120b`; all other models are blocked by the organization.

<br />

**Scenario 2: Project permissions only**
- **Org:** No restrictions (all models available)
- **Project:** Only Block `openai/gpt-oss-120b`

**Result:** Project can use all models except `openai/gpt-oss-120b`.

<br />

**Scenario 3: Only Allow org → Only Allow subset on project**
- **Org:** Only Allow `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, `openai/gpt-oss-120b`
- **Project:** Only Allow `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, `llama-3.1-8b-instant`

**Result:** Project can use `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` and `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, as the project permissions narrow it down. The organization allowed `openai/gpt-oss-120b` is blocked by the project. All other models are blocked by the organization.

<br />

**Scenario 4: Only Allow org → Block subset on project**
- **Org:** Only Allow `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, `openai/gpt-oss-120b`
- **Project:** Only Block `openai/gpt-oss-120b`

**Result:** Project can use `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` and `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, as the project blocks `openai/gpt-oss-120b` from the organization's allowed set. All other models are blocked by the organization.

<br />

**Scenario 5: Only Block org → Only Allow subset on project**
- **Org:** Only Block `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, `openai/gpt-oss-20b`
- **Project:** Only Allow `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, `llama-3.1-8b-instant`

**Result:** Project can only use `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` and `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, as the project only allows a subset from the organization's allowed set. All other models are blocked by the project.

<br />

**Scenario 6: Only Block org → Block more on project**
- **Org:** Only Block `openai/gpt-oss-120b`
- **Project:** Only Block `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`

**Result:** Project blocked from using both `openai/gpt-oss-120b` and `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`. The project level permissions combine with the organization-level permissions to block both models. All other models are available.

## FAQ

### Can I configure different permission strategies for different projects?

Yes, each project can have its own "only allow" or "only block" strategy. However, all project permissions are limited by organization-level settings.

### What happens if I block all models?

All API requests will be rejected with a 403 `permissions_error`.

### Can I temporarily disable model permissions?

Yes, you can modify or remove permission settings at any time. Changes take effect immediately.

### Do model permissions affect existing API keys?

Yes, permissions apply to all API requests regardless of which API key is used. Restrictions are based on the organization and project, not the API key.

### Can a project enable a model that's blocked at the org level?

No, organization-level blocks always take precedence. Projects can only further restrict access, not expand it.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/mcp

# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open-source standard that enables AI applications to connect with external systems like databases, APIs, and tools. Think of MCP as a "USB-C port for AI applications" - it provides a standardized way for AI models to access and interact with your data and workflows.

## What is MCP?

As a developer, you know how powerful AI can be when it has access to the right information and tools. But connecting AI models to your existing systems has traditionally required custom integrations for each service. MCP solves this problem by creating a universal protocol that lets AI models securely connect to any external system.

### Real-World Examples

With MCP, you can build AI agents that:

- **Access your codebase**: Let AI read GitHub repositories, create issues, and manage pull requests
- **Query your database**: Enable natural language queries against PostgreSQL, MySQL, or any database
- **Browse the web**: Give AI the ability to search and extract information from websites
- **Control your tools**: Connect to Slack, Notion, Google Calendar, or any API-based service
- **Analyze your data**: Let AI work with spreadsheets, documents, and business intelligence tools

### Why Use MCP with Groq?

Groq's implementation of MCP provides significant advantages:

- **Drop-in compatibility**: Existing OpenAI Responses + MCP integrations work with just an endpoint change
- **Superior performance**: Groq's speed makes tool-using agents feel snappier and more reliable
- **Cost efficiency**: Run the same AI experiences more cost-effectively at scale
- **Built-in security**: Clear approval controls and allowlists help teams control tool usage

## Supported Models

Remote MCP is available on all models that support [tool use](/docs/tool-use):

| Model ID                        | Model                          |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| openai/gpt-oss-20b                  | GPT-OSS 20B                  |
| openai/gpt-oss-120b                  | GPT-OSS 120B                  |
| qwen/qwen3-32b                  | Qwen3 32B                  |
| moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct-0905                  | Kimi K2 Instruct                  |
| meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct | Llama 4 Maverick                  |
| meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct | Llama 4 Scout                  |
| llama-3.3-70b-versatile | Llama 3.3 70B                  |
| llama-3.1-8b-instant | Llama 3.1 8B Instant                  |

## Getting Started

MCP works by adding external tools to your AI model requests through the `tools` parameter. Each MCP tool specifies:

- **Server details**: Where to connect (URL, authentication)
- **Tool restrictions**: Which operations are allowed
- **Approval settings**: Whether human approval is required

### Your First MCP Request

Here's a simple example using [Hugging Face's MCP server](https://huggingface.co/settings/mcp) to search for trending AI models.

## MCP Examples

### Firecrawl Integration

Connect to [Firecrawl's MCP server](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/mcp-server) for automated web scraping and data extraction. 

### Web Search

Enable natural language web search for your AI agents with [Parallel's MCP server](https://docs.parallel.ai/features/remote-mcp). 

### Creating an Invoice

Automate your invoicing process with [Stripe's MCP server](https://docs.stripe.com/mcp). 

Other payment processors also support MCP. For example, [PayPal's MCP server](https://www.paypal.ai/docs/tools/mcp-quickstart#remote-mcp-server) allows you to create invoices, manage payments, and more.

## Advanced Features

### Multiple MCP Servers

You can connect to multiple MCP servers in a single request, allowing AI to coordinate across different systems.

### Authentication & Security

MCP servers often require authentication. Groq handles credentials securely:

- **Headers sent only to MCP servers**: Tokens are only transmitted to the specific server URL
- **Redacted logs**: Authentication headers are automatically redacted from logs

### Connection Troubleshooting

In the case of authentication issues, you will receive a `424 Failed Dependency` error.

## Limitations

While Groq's MCP implementation is fully compatible with OpenAI's remote MCP specification, there are some limitations to be aware of:

- Approvals are not yet supported (`"require_approval": true`)
- Streaming is not yet supported (`"streaming": true`)
- Filtering tools is not yet supported (`"allowed_tools": ["tool1", "tool2"]`)

## OpenAI Compatibility

Groq's MCP implementation is fully compatible with [OpenAI's remote MCP specification](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-connectors-mcp). Existing integrations typically only need to change:

- **Base URL**: From `https://api.openai.com/v1` to `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`
- **Model name**: To a [Groq-supported model](/docs/models) like `openai/gpt-oss-120b`
- **API key**: To your [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/keys)

## Using MCP with Chat Completions

While we recommend the Responses API for its native MCP support, you can also use MCP with the Chat Completions API.

## Next Steps

- **Explore the [Responses API](/docs/responses-api)** for the full MCP experience
- **Check out [MCP servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)** for ready-to-use integrations
- **Build your own MCP server** using the [MCP specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/)

## Visit Website

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/visit-website

# Visit Website

Some models and systems on Groq have native support for visiting and analyzing specific websites, allowing them to access current web content and provide detailed analysis based on the actual page content. This tool enables models to retrieve and process content from any publicly accessible website.

The use of this tool with a supported model or system in GroqCloud is not a HIPAA Covered Cloud Service under Groq's Business Associate Addendum at this time. This tool is also not available currently for use with regional / sovereign endpoints.

## Supported Models

Built-in website visiting is supported for the following models and systems (on versions later than `2025-07-23`):

| Model ID                        | Model                          |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| groq/compound                   | [Compound](/docs/compound/systems/compound)
| groq/compound-mini              | [Compound Mini](/docs/compound/systems/compound-mini)

<br />

For a comparison between the `groq/compound` and `groq/compound-mini` systems and more information regarding extra capabilities, see the [Compound Systems](/docs/compound/systems#system-comparison) page.

## Quick Start

To use website visiting, simply include a URL in your request to one of the supported models. The examples below show how to access all parts of the response: the final content, reasoning process, and tool execution details.

*These examples show how to access the complete response structure to understand the website visiting process.*

<br />

When the API is called, it will automatically detect URLs in the user's message and visit the specified website to retrieve its content. The response includes three key components:
- **Content**: The final synthesized response from the model
- **Reasoning**: The internal decision-making process showing the website visit
- **Executed Tools**: Detailed information about the website that was visited

## How It Works

When you include a URL in your request:

1. **URL Detection**: The system automatically detects URLs in your message
2. **Website Visit**: The tool fetches the content from the specified website  
3. **Content Processing**: The website content is processed and made available to the model
4. **Response Generation**: The model uses both your query and the website content to generate a comprehensive response

### Final Output

This is the final response from the model, containing the analysis based on the visited website content. The model can summarize, analyze, extract specific information, or answer questions about the website's content.

**Key Take-aways from "Inside the LPU: Deconstructing Groq's Speed"**

| Area | What Groq does differently | Why it matters |
|------|----------------------------|----------------|
| **Numerics – TruePoint** | Uses a mixed-precision scheme that keeps 100-bit accumulation while storing weights/activations in lower-precision formats (FP8, BF16, block-floating-point). | Gives 2-4× speed-up over pure BF16 **without** the accuracy loss that typical INT8/FP8 quantization causes. |
| **Memory hierarchy** | Hundreds of megabytes of on-chip **SRAM** act as the primary weight store, not a cache layer. | Eliminates the 100-ns-plus latency of DRAM/HBM fetches that dominate inference workloads, enabling fast, deterministic weight access. |
| **Execution model – static scheduling** | The compiler fully unrolls the execution graph (including inter-chip communication) down to the clock-cycle level. | Removes dynamic-scheduling overhead (queues, reorder buffers, speculation) → deterministic latency, perfect for tensor-parallelism and pipelining. |
| **Parallelism strategy** | Focuses on **tensor parallelism** (splitting a single layer across many LPUs) rather than pure data parallelism. | Reduces latency for a single request; a trillion-parameter model can generate tokens in real-time. |
| **Speculative decoding** | Runs a small "draft" model to propose tokens, then verifies a batch of those tokens on the large model using the LPU's pipeline-parallel hardware. | Verification is no longer memory-bandwidth bound; 2-4 tokens can be accepted per pipeline stage, compounding speed gains. |

[...truncated for brevity]

**Bottom line:** Groq's LPU architecture combines precision-aware numerics, on-chip SRAM, deterministic static scheduling, aggressive tensor-parallelism, efficient speculative decoding, and a tightly synchronized inter-chip network to deliver dramatically lower inference latency without compromising model quality.

### Reasoning and Internal Tool Calls

This shows the model's internal reasoning process and the website visit it executed to gather information. You can inspect this to understand how the model approached the problem and what URL it accessed. This is useful for debugging and understanding the model's decision-making process.

<br />

**Inside the LPU: Deconstructing Groq's Speed**

Moonshot's Kimi K2 recently launched in preview on GroqCloud and developers keep asking us: how is Groq running a 1-trillion-parameter model this fast?

Legacy hardware forces a choice: faster inference with quality degradation, or accurate inference with unacceptable latency. This tradeoff exists because GPU architectures optimize for training workloads. The LPU–purpose-built hardware for inference–preserves quality while eliminating architectural bottlenecks which create latency in the first place.

### Accuracy Without Tradeoffs: TruePoint Numerics

Traditional accelerators achieve speed through aggressive quantization, forcing models into INT8 or lower precision numerics that introduce cumulative errors throughout the computation pipeline and lead to loss of quality.

[...truncated for brevity]

### The Bottom Line

Groq isn't tweaking around the edges. We build inference from the ground up for speed, scale, reliability and cost-efficiency. That's how we got Kimi K2 running at 40× performance in just 72 hours.

### Tool Execution Details

This shows the details of the website visit operation, including the type of tool executed and the content that was retrieved from the website.

## Usage Tips

- **Single URL per Request**: Only one website will be visited per request. If multiple URLs are provided, only the first one will be processed.
- **Publicly Accessible Content**: The tool can only visit publicly accessible websites that don't require authentication.
- **Content Processing**: The tool automatically extracts the main content while filtering out navigation, ads, and other non-essential elements.
- **Real-time Access**: Each request fetches fresh content from the website at the time of the request, rendering the full page to capture dynamic content.

## FlutterFlow + Groq: Fast & Powerful Cross-Platform Apps

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/flutterflow

## FlutterFlow + Groq: Fast & Powerful Cross-Platform Apps

[**FlutterFlow**](https://flutterflow.io/) is a visual development platform to build high-quality, custom, cross-platform apps. By leveraging Groq's fast AI inference in FlutterFlow, you can build beautiful AI-powered apps to:


- **Build for Scale**: Collaborate efficiently to create robust apps that grow with your needs.
- **Iterate Fast**: Rapidly test, refine, and deploy your app, accelerating your development.
- **Fully Integrate Your Project**: Access databases, APIs, and custom widgets in one place.
- **Deploy Cross-Platform**: Launch on iOS, Android, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

### FlutterFlow + Groq Quick Start (10 minutes to hello world)

#### 1. Securely store your Groq API Key in FlutterFlow as an App State Variable

Go to the App Values tab in the FlutterFlow Builder, add `groqApiKey` as an app state variable, and enter your API key. It should have type `String` and be `persisted` (that way, the API Key is remembered even if you close out of your application). 

![*Store your api key securely as an App State variable by selecting "secure persisted fields"*](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_1.png)

*Store your api key securely as an App State variable by selecting "secure persisted fields"*

#### 2. Create a call to the Groq API

Next, navigate to the API calls tab
Create a new API call, call it `Groq Completion`, set the method type as `POST`, and for the API URL, use: https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions

Now, add the following variables: 

- `token` - This is your Groq API key, which you can get from the App Values tab.
- `model` - This is the model you want to use. For this example, we'll use `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`.
- `text` - This is the text you want to send to the Groq API.

![Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 12.05.22 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_2.png)

#### 3. Define your API call header

Once you have added the relevant variables, define your API call header. You can reference the token variable you defined by putting it in square brackets ([]).

Define your API call header as follows: `Authorization: Bearer [token]`

![Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 12.05.38 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_3.png)

#### 4. Define the body of your API call

You can drag and drop your variables into the JSON body, or include them in angle brackets.

Select JSON, and add the following: 
- `model` - This is the model we defined in the variables section.
- `messages` - This is the message you want to send to the Groq API. We need to add the 'text' variable we defined in the variables section within the message within the system-message.

You can modify the system message to fit your specific use-case. We are going to use a generic system message:
"Provide a helpful answer for the following question - text"

![Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 12.05.49 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_4.png)

#### 5. Test your API call

By clicking on the “Response & Test” button, you can test your API call. Provide values for your variables, and hit “Test API call” to see the response. 

![Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 12.32.34 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_5.png)

#### 6. Save relevant JSON Paths of the response
Once you have your API response, you can save relevant JSON Paths of the response. 
To save the content of the response from Groq, you can scroll down and click “Add JSON Path” for `$.choices[:].message.content` and provide a name for it, such as “groqResponse” 

![Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 12.34.22 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_6.png)

#### 7. Connect the API call to your UI with an action

Now that you have added & tested your API call, let’s connect the API call to your UI with an action.

*If you are interested in following along, you can* [**clone the project**](https://app.flutterflow.io/project/groq-documentation-vc2rt1) *and include your own API Key. You can also follow along with this [3-minute video.](https://www.loom.com/share/053ee6ab744e4cf4a5179fac1405a800?sid=4960f7cd-2b29-4538-89bb-51aa5b76946c)* 

In this page, we create a simple UI that includes a TextField for a user to input their question, a button to trigger our Groq Completion API call, and a Text widget to display the result from the API. We define a page state variable, groqResult, which will be updated to the result from the API. We then bind the Text widget to our page state variable groqResult, as shown below. 

![Screenshot 2025-02-25 at 3.58.57 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_8.png)

#### 8. Define an action that calls our API

Now that we have created our UI, we can add an action to our button that will call the API, and update our Text with the API’s response. 
To do this, click on the button, open the action editor, and add an action to call the Groq Completion API.

![Screenshot 2025-02-25 at 4.05.30 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_9.png)

To create our first action to the Groq endpoint, create an action of type Backend API call, and set the "group or call name" to `Groq Completion`.
Then add two additional variables:
- `token` - This is your Groq API key, which you can get from the App State tab.
- `text` - This is the text you want to send to the Groq API, which you can get from the TextField widget.

Finally, rename the action output to `groqResponse`.
![Screenshot 2025-02-25 at 4.57.28 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_10.png)

#### 9. Update the page state variable

Once the API call succeeds, we can update our page state variable `groqResult` to the contents of the API response from Groq, using the JSON path we created when defining the API call. 

Click on the "+" button for True, and add an action of type "Update Page State". 
Add a field for `groqResult`, and set the value to `groqResponse`, found under Action Output. 
Select `JSON Body` for the API Response Options, `Predifined Path` Path for the Available Options, and `groqResponse` for the Path.

![Screenshot 2025-02-25 at 5.03.33 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_11.png)

![Screenshot 2025-02-25 at 5.03.47 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_12.png)

#### 10. Run your app in test mode

Now that we have connected our API call to the UI as an action, we can run our app in test mode.

*Watch a [video](https://www.loom.com/share/8f965557a51d43c7ba518280b9c4fd12?sid=006c88e6-a0f2-4c31-bf03-6ba7fc8178a3) of the app live in test mode.*

# Billing FAQs

## Upgrading to Developer Tier

### What happens when I upgrade to the Developer tier?

When you upgrade, **there's no immediate charge** - you'll be billed for tokens at month-end or when you reach progressive billing thresholds (see below for details).

To upgrade from the Free tier to the Developer tier, you'll need to provide a valid payment method (credit card, US bank account, or SEPA debit account). 

Your upgrade takes effect immediately, but billing only occurs at the end of your monthly billing cycle or when you cross progressive thresholds ($1, $10, $100, $500, $1,000; see below for details).

### What are the benefits of upgrading?

The Developer tier is designed for developers and companies who want increased capacity and more features with pay-as-you-go pricing. Immediately after upgrading, you unlock several benefits:

**Core Features:**
- **Higher Token Limits:** Significantly increased rate limits for production workloads
- **Chat Support:** Direct access to our support team via chat
- **[Flex Service Tier](/docs/flex-processing):** Flexible processing options for your workloads
- **[Batch Processing](/docs/batch):** Submit and process large batches of requests efficiently
- **[Spend Limits](/docs/spend-limits):** Set automated spending limits and receive budget alerts

### Can I downgrade back to the Free tier after I upgrade?

Yes, you can downgrade to the Free tier at any time from your account Settings under [**Billing**](/settings/billing).

> **Note:** When you downgrade, we will issue a final invoice for any outstanding usage that has not yet been billed. You'll need to pay this final invoice before the downgrade is complete.

After downgrading:
- Your account returns to Free tier rate limits and restrictions
- You'll lose access to Developer tier benefits (priority support, unlimited requests, etc.)
- Any usage-based charges stop immediately
- You can upgrade again at any time if you need more capacity

## Understanding Groq's Billing Model

### How does Groq's billing cycle work?

Groq uses a monthly billing cycle, where you receive an invoice in arrears for usage. However, for new users, we also apply progressive billing thresholds to help ease you into pay-as-you-go usage.

### How does progressive billing work?

When you first start using Groq on the Developer plan, your billing follows a progressive billing model. In this model, an invoice is automatically triggered and payment is deducted when your cumulative usage reaches specific thresholds: $1, $10, $100, $500, and $1,000.

<br/>

**Special billing for customers in India:** Customers with a billing address in India have different progressive billing thresholds. For India customers, the thresholds are only $1, $10, and then $100 recurring. The $500 and $1,000 thresholds do not apply to India customers. Instead, after reaching the initial $1 and $10 thresholds, billing will continue to trigger every time usage reaches another $100 increment.

<br/>

This helps you monitor early usage and ensures you're not surprised by a large first bill. These are one-time thresholds for most customers. Once you cross the $1,000 lifetime usage threshold, only monthly billing continues (this does not apply to India customers who continue with recurring $100 billing).


### What if I don't reach the next threshold?

If you don't reach the next threshold, your usage will be billed on your regular end-of-month invoice.

<br/>

**Example:**
- You cross $1 → you're charged immediately.
- You then use $2 more for the entire month (lifetime usage = $3, still below $10).
- That $2 will be invoiced at the end of your monthly billing cycle, not immediately.

This ensures you're not repeatedly charged for small amounts and are charged only when hitting a lifetime cumulative threshold or when your billing period ends.

<br/>

Once your lifetime usage crosses the $1,000 threshold, the progressive thresholds no longer apply. From this point forward, your account is billed solely on a monthly cycle. All future usage is accrued and billed once per month, with payment automatically deducted when the invoice is issued.

### When is payment withdrawn from my account?

Payment is withdrawn automatically from your connected payment method each time an invoice is issued. This can happen in two cases:

- **Progressive billing phase:** When your usage first crosses the $1, $10, $100, $500, or $1,000 thresholds. For customers in India, payment is withdrawn at $1, $10, and then every $100 thereafter (the $500 and $1,000 thresholds do not apply).
- **Monthly billing phase:** At the end of each monthly billing cycle.

> **Note:** We only bill you once your usage has reached at least $0.50. If you see a total charge of < $0.50 or you get an invoice for < $0.50, there is no action required on your end.

## Monitoring Your Spending & Usage

### How can I view my current usage and spending in real time?

You can monitor your usage and charges in near real-time directly within your Groq Cloud dashboard. Simply navigate to [**Dashboard** → **Usage**](/dashboard/usage)

This dashboard allows you to:
- Track your current usage across models
- Understand how your consumption aligns with pricing per model

### Can I set spending limits or receive budget alerts?

Yes, Groq provides Spend Limits to help you control your API costs. You can set automated spending limits and receive proactive usage alerts as you approach your defined budget thresholds. [**More details here**](/docs/spend-limits)

## Invoices, Billing Info & Credits

### Where can I find my past invoices and payment history?

You can view and download all your invoices and receipts in the Groq Console:
[**Settings** → **Billing** → **Manage Billing**](/settings/billing/manage)

### Can I change my billing info and payment method?

You can update your billing details anytime from the Groq Console:
[**Settings** → **Billing** → **Manage Billing**](/settings/billing/manage)

### What payment methods do you accept?

Groq accepts credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover), United States bank accounts, and SEPA debit accounts as payment methods.

### Are there promotional credits, or trial offers?

Yes! We occasionally offer promotional credits, such as during hackathons and special events. We encourage you to visit our [**Groq Community**](https://community.groq.com/) page to learn more and stay updated on announcements.

<br/>

If you're building a startup, you may be eligible for the [**Groq for Startups**](https://groq.com/groq-for-startups) program, which unlocks $10,000 in credits to help you scale faster.

## Projects

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/projects

# Projects

Projects provide organizations with a powerful framework for managing multiple applications, environments, and teams within a single Groq account. By organizing your work into projects, you can isolate workloads to gain granular control over resources, costs, access permissions, and usage tracking on a per-project basis.

## Why Use Projects?
- **Isolation and Organization:** Projects create logical boundaries between different applications, environments (development, staging, production), and use cases. This prevents resource conflicts and enables clear separation of concerns across your organization.
- **Cost Control and Visibility:** Track spending, usage patterns, and resource consumption at the project level. This granular visibility enables accurate cost allocation, budget management, and ROI analysis for specific initiatives.
- **Team Collaboration:** Control who can access what resources through project-based permissions. Teams can work independently within their projects while maintaining organizational oversight and governance.
- **Operational Excellence:** Configure rate limits, monitor performance, and debug issues at the project level. This enables optimized resource allocation and simplified troubleshooting workflows.

## Project Structure
Projects inherit settings and permissions from your organization while allowing project-specific customization. Your organization-level role determines your maximum permissions within any project.

Each project acts as an isolated workspace containing:

- **API Keys:** Project-specific credentials for secure access
- **Rate Limits:** Customizable quotas for each available model
- **Usage Data:** Consumption metrics, costs, and request logs
- **Team Access:** Role-based permissions for project members

The following are the roles that are inherited from your organization along with their permissions within a project:

- **Owner:** Full access to creating, updating, and deleting projects, modifying limits for models within projects, managing API keys, viewing usage and spending data across all projects, and managing project access.
- **Developer:** Currently same as Owner.
- **Reader:** Read-only access to projects and usage metrics, logs, and spending data.

## Getting Started
### Creating Your First Project
**1. Access Projects**: Navigate to the **Projects** section at the top lefthand side of the Console. You will see a dropdown that looks like **Organization** / **Projects**.
<br />
**2. Create Project:** Click the rightside **Projects** dropdown and click **Create Project** to create a new project by inputting a project name. You will also notice that there is an option to **Manage Projects** that will be useful later.
  > 
  > **Note:** Create separate projects for development, staging, and production environments, and use descriptive, consistent naming conventions (e.g. "myapp-dev", "myapp-staging", "myapp-prod") to avoid conflicts and maintain clear project boundaries.
  > 
<br />
**3. Configure Settings**: Once you create a project, you will be able to see it in the dropdown and under **Manage Projects**. Click **Manage Projects** and click **View** to customize project rate limits.
>
> **Note:** Start with conservative limits for new projects, increase limits based on actual usage patterns and needs, and monitor usage regularly to adjust as needed.
>
<br />
**4. Generate API Keys:** Once you've configured your project and selected it in the dropdown, it will persist across the console. Any API keys generated will be specific to the project you have selected. Any logs will also be project-specific.
<br />
**5. Start Building:** Begin making API calls using your project-specific API credentials

### Project Selection
Use the project selector in the top navigation to switch between projects. All Console sections automatically filter to show data for the selected project:
- API Keys
- Batch Jobs
- Logs and Usage Analytics

## Rate Limit Management
### Understanding Rate Limits
Rate limits control the maximum number of requests your project can make to models within a specific time window. Rate limits are applied per project, meaning each project has its own separate quota that doesn't interfere with other projects in your organization.
Each project can be configured to have custom rate limits for every available model, which allows you to:

- Allocate higher limits to production projects
- Set conservative limits for experimental or development projects
- Customize limits based on specific use case requirements

Custom project rate limits can only be set to values equal to or lower than your organization's limits. Setting a custom rate limit for a project does not increase your organization's overall limits, it only allows you to set more restrictive limits for that specific project. Organization limits always take precedence and act as a ceiling for all project limits.

### Configuring Rate Limits
To configure rate limits for a project:
1. Navigate to **Projects** in your settings
2. Select the project you want to configure
3. Adjust the limits for each model as needed

### Example: Rate Limits Across Projects

Let's say you've created three projects for your application:
- myapp-prod for production
- myapp-staging for testing
- myapp-dev for development

**Scenario:**

- Organization Limit: 100 requests per minute
- myapp-prod: 80 requests per minute
- myapp-staging: 30 requests per minute
- myapp-dev: Using default organization limits


**Here's how the rate limits work in practice:**

1. myapp-prod
   - Can make up to 80 requests per minute (custom project limit)
   - Even if other projects are idle, cannot exceed 80 requests per minute
   - Contributing to the organization's total limit of 100 requests per minute

2. myapp-staging
   - Limited to 30 requests per minute (custom project limit)
   - Cannot exceed this limit even if organization has capacity
   - Contributing to the organization's total limit of 100 requests per minute

3. myapp-dev
   - Inherits the organization limit of 100 requests per minute
   - Actual available capacity depends on usage from other projects
   - If myapp-prod is using 80 requests/min and myapp-staging is using 15 requests/min, myapp-dev can only use 5 requests/min

**What happens during high concurrent usage:**

If both myapp-prod and myapp-staging try to use their maximum configured limits simultaneously:
- myapp-prod attempts to use 80 requests/min
- myapp-staging attempts to use 30 requests/min
- Total attempted usage: 110 requests/min
- Organization limit: 100 requests/min

In this case, some requests will fail with rate limit errors because the combined usage exceeds the organization's limit. Even though each project is within its configured limits, the organization limit of 100 requests/min acts as a hard ceiling. 

## Usage Tracking
Projects provide comprehensive usage tracking including:

- Monthly spend tracking: Monitor costs and spending patterns for each project
- Usage metrics: Track API calls, token usage, and request patterns
- Request logs: Access detailed logs for debugging and monitoring

Dashboard pages will automatically be filtered by your selected project. Access these insights by:

1. Selecting your project in the top left of the navigation bar
2. Navigate to the **Dashboard** to see your project-specific **Usage**, **Metrics**, and **Logs** pages

## ✨ Vercel AI SDK + Groq: Rapid App Development

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/ai-sdk

## ✨ Vercel AI SDK + Groq: Rapid App Development

Vercel's AI SDK enables seamless integration with Groq, providing developers with powerful tools to leverage language models hosted on Groq for a variety of applications. By combining Vercel's cutting-edge platform with Groq's advanced inference capabilities, developers can create scalable, high-speed applications with ease.

### Why Choose the Vercel AI SDK?
- A versatile toolkit for building applications powered by advanced language models like Llama 3.3 70B 
- Ideal for creating chat interfaces, document summarization, and natural language generation
- Simple setup and flexible provider configurations for diverse use cases
- Fully supports standalone usage and seamless deployment with Vercel
- Scalable and efficient for handling complex tasks with minimal configuration

### Quick Start Guide in JavaScript (5 minutes to deployment)

#### 1. Create a new Next.js project with the AI SDK template:
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-groq-app --typescript --tailwind --src-dir
cd my-groq-app
```
#### 2. Install the required packages:
```bash
npm install @ai-sdk/groq ai
npm install react-markdown
```

#### 3. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root and configure your Groq API Key:
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

#### 4. Create a new directory structure for your Groq API endpoint:
```bash
mkdir -p src/app/api/chat
```

#### 5. Initialize the AI SDK by creating an API route file called `route.ts` in `app/api/chat`:
```javascript
import { groq } from '@ai-sdk/groq';
import { streamText } from 'ai';

// Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: groq('llama-3.3-70b-versatile'),
    messages,
  });

  return result.toDataStreamResponse();
}
```

**Challenge**: Now that you have your basic chat interface working, try enhancing it to create a specialized code explanation assistant! 


#### 6. Create your front end interface by updating the `app/page.tsx` file:
```javascript
'use client';

import { useChat } from 'ai/react';

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat();

  return (

## AutoGen + Groq: Building Multi-Agent AI Applications

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/autogen

## AutoGen + Groq: Building Multi-Agent AI Applications

[AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) developed by [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/research/) is an open-source framework for building multi-agent AI applications. By powering the
AutoGen agentic framework with Groq's fast inference speed, you can create sophisticated AI agents that work together to solve complex tasks fast with features including:

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Create and manage multiple agents that can collaborate in realtime
- **Tool Integration:** Easily connect agents with external tools and APIs
- **Flexible Workflows:** Support both autonomous and human-in-the-loop conversation patterns
- **Code Generation & Execution:** Enable agents to write, review, and execute code safely


### Python Quick Start (3 minutes to hello world)
#### 1. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install autogen-agentchat~=0.2 groq
```

#### 2. Configure your Groq API key:
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
```

#### 3. Create your first multi-agent application with Groq:
In AutoGen, **agents** are autonomous entities that can engage in conversations and perform tasks. The example below shows how to create a simple two-agent system with `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` where
`UserProxyAgent` initiates the conversation with a question and `AssistantAgent` responds:

```python
import os
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent

# Configure
config_list = [{
    "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
    "api_key": os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY"),
    "api_type": "groq"
}]

# Create an AI assistant
assistant = AssistantAgent(
    name="groq_assistant",
    system_message="You are a helpful AI assistant.",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list}
)

# Create a user proxy agent (no code execution in this example)
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    code_execution_config=False
)

# Start a conversation between the agents
user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    assistant,
    message="What are the key benefits of using Groq for AI apps?"
)
```


### Advanced Features

#### Code Generation and Execution
You can enable secure code execution by configuring the `UserProxyAgent` that allows your agents to write and execute Python code in a controlled environment:
```python
from pathlib import Path
from autogen.coding import LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor

# Create a directory to store code files
work_dir = Path("coding")
work_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
code_executor = LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor(work_dir=work_dir)

# Configure the UserProxyAgent with code execution
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    code_execution_config={"executor": code_executor}
)
```

#### Tool Integration
You can add tools for your agents to use by creating a function and registering it with the assistant. Here's an example of a weather forecast tool:
```python
from typing import Annotated

def get_current_weather(location, unit="fahrenheit"):
    """Get the weather for some location"""
    weather_data = {
        "berlin": {"temperature": "13"},
        "istanbul": {"temperature": "40"},
        "san francisco": {"temperature": "55"}
    }
    
    location_lower = location.lower()
    if location_lower in weather_data:
        return json.dumps({
            "location": location.title(),
            "temperature": weather_data[location_lower]["temperature"],
            "unit": unit
        })
    return json.dumps({"location": location, "temperature": "unknown"})

# Register the tool with the assistant
@assistant.register_for_llm(description="Weather forecast for cities.")
def weather_forecast(
    location: Annotated[str, "City name"],
    unit: Annotated[str, "Temperature unit (fahrenheit/celsius)"] = "fahrenheit"
) -> str:
    weather_details = get_current_weather(location=location, unit=unit)
    weather = json.loads(weather_details)
    return f"{weather['location']} will be {weather['temperature']} degrees {weather['unit']}"
```

#### Complete Code Example
Here is our quick start agent code example combined with code execution and tool use that you can play with:
```python
import os
import json
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Annotated
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent
from autogen.coding import LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor

# Configure Groq
config_list = [{
    "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
    "api_key": os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY"),
    "api_type": "groq"
}]

# Create a directory to store code files from code executor
work_dir = Path("coding")
work_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
code_executor = LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor(work_dir=work_dir)

# Define weather tool
def get_current_weather(location, unit="fahrenheit"):
    """Get the weather for some location"""
    weather_data = {
        "berlin": {"temperature": "13"},
        "istanbul": {"temperature": "40"},
        "san francisco": {"temperature": "55"}
    }
    
    location_lower = location.lower()
    if location_lower in weather_data:
        return json.dumps({
            "location": location.title(),
            "temperature": weather_data[location_lower]["temperature"],
            "unit": unit
        })
    return json.dumps({"location": location, "temperature": "unknown"})

# Create an AI assistant that uses the weather tool
assistant = AssistantAgent(
    name="groq_assistant",
    system_message="""You are a helpful AI assistant who can:
    - Use weather information tools
    - Write Python code for data visualization
    - Analyze and explain results""",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list}
)

# Register weather tool with the assistant
@assistant.register_for_llm(description="Weather forecast for cities.")
def weather_forecast(
    location: Annotated[str, "City name"],
    unit: Annotated[str, "Temperature unit (fahrenheit/celsius)"] = "fahrenheit"
) -> str:
    weather_details = get_current_weather(location=location, unit=unit)
    weather = json.loads(weather_details)
    return f"{weather['location']} will be {weather['temperature']} degrees {weather['unit']}"

# Create a user proxy agent that only handles code execution
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    code_execution_config={"executor": code_executor}
)

# Start the conversation
user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    assistant,
    message="""Let's do two things:
    1. Get the weather for Berlin, Istanbul, and San Francisco
    2. Write a Python script to create a bar chart comparing their temperatures"""
)
```

## Content Moderation

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/content-moderation

# Content Moderation

User prompts can sometimes include harmful, inappropriate, or policy-violating content that can be used to exploit models in production to generate unsafe content. To address this issue, we can utilize safeguard models for content moderation.

Content moderation for models involves detecting and filtering harmful or unwanted content in user prompts and model responses. This is essential to ensure safe and responsible use of models. By integrating robust content moderation, we can build trust with users, comply with regulatory standards, and maintain a safe environment.

Groq offers multiple models for content moderation:

**Policy-Following Models:**
- [**GPT-OSS-Safeguard 20B**](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-safeguard-20b) - A reasoning model from OpenAI for customizable Trust & Safety workflows with bring-your-own-policy capabilities

**Prebaked Safety Models:**
- [**Llama Guard 4**](/docs/model/meta-llama/llama-guard-4-12b) - A 12B parameter multimodal model from Meta that takes text and image as input
- [**Llama Prompt Guard 2 (86M)**](/docs/model/meta-llama/llama-prompt-guard-2-86m) - A lightweight prompt injection detection model
- [**Llama Prompt Guard 2 (22M)**](/docs/model/meta-llama/llama-prompt-guard-2-22m) - An ultra-lightweight prompt injection detection model

## GPT-OSS-Safeguard 20B

GPT-OSS-Safeguard 20B is OpenAI's first open weight reasoning model specifically trained for safety classification tasks. Unlike prebaked safety models with fixed taxonomies, GPT-OSS-Safeguard is a policy-following model that interprets and enforces your own written standards. This enables bring-your-own-policy Trust & Safety AI, where your own taxonomy, definitions, and thresholds guide classification decisions.

Well-crafted policies unlock GPT-OSS-Safeguard's reasoning capabilities, enabling it to handle nuanced content, explain borderline decisions, and adapt to contextual factors without retraining. The model uses the Harmony response format, which separates reasoning into dedicated channels for auditability and transparency.

### Example: Prompt Injection Detection

This example demonstrates how to use GPT-OSS-Safeguard 20B with a custom policy to detect prompt injection attempts:

Example Output
```
{
  "violation": 1,
  "category": "Direct Override",
  "rationale": "The input explicitly attempts to override system instructions by introducing the 'DAN' persona and requesting unrestricted behavior, which constitutes a clear prompt injection attack."
}
```

The model analyzes the input against the policy and returns a structured JSON response indicating whether it's a violation, the category, and an explanation of its reasoning. Learn more about [GPT-OSS-Safeguard 20B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-safeguard-20b).

## Llama Guard 4
Llama Guard 4 is a natively multimodal safeguard model that is designed to process and classify content in both model inputs (prompt classification) and model responses (response classification) for both text and images, making it capable of content moderation across multiple formats. When used, Llama Guard 4 generates text output that indicates whether a given prompt or response is safe or unsafe. If the content is deemed unsafe, it also lists the specific content categories that are violated as per the Harm Taxonomy and Policy outlined below.
Llama Guard 4 applies a probability-based approach to produce classifier scores. The model generates a probability score for the first token, which is then used as the "unsafe" class probability. This score can be thresholded to make binary decisions about the safety of the content.

<figure>
  <img src="/content-moderation/llamaguard3-example.png" alt="Figure 1" />
  <figcaption className='text-xs'>Figure 1: Illustration of task instructions used by Llama Guard for assessing the safety of conversational prompts and responses. The model evaluates both the user's input and the agent's reply against predefined unsafe content categories, determining whether the content is 'safe' or 'unsafe' based on provided criteria. </figcaption>
</figure>

## Usage

The Llama Guard 4 model can be executed as an ordinary Groq API chat completion with the `meta-llama/Llama-Guard-4-12B` model. When using Llama Guard 4 with Groq, no system message is required; just run the message you'd like screened through the chat completion request as the user or assistant message:

Example Output
```
unsafe
S2
```

If Llama Guard 4 detects that your message violates any of the harmful categories, it will respond `unsafe` followed by the violated category on a new line (i.e. `unsafe\nS2`). If your message is safe, it will simply respond `safe`.

Llama Guard 4 is also available as a feature in our [Playground](https://console.groq.com/playground) under Advanced parameters:
<img src="/content-moderation/llamaguard3-playground.png" alt="Alt text" style={{ width: '300px' }} />

## Harm Taxonomy and Policy

Llama Guard 4 is trained to predict safety labels on the following categories, based on the [MLCommons taxonomy](https://mlcommons.org/2024/04/mlc-aisafety-v0-5-poc/) of hazards. 

<br />

**S1) Violent Crimes:** Responses that enable, encourage, or endorse the commission of violent crimes, including: (1) unlawful violence toward people (ex: terrorism, genocide, murder, hate-motivated violent crimes, child abuse, assault, battery, kidnapping) and (2) unlawful violence toward animals (ex: animal abuse)

**S2) Non-Violent Crimes:** Responses that enable, encourage, or endorse the commission of non-violent crimes, including: (1) personal crimes (ex: labor trafficking, threats, intimidation, hate-motivated non-violent crimes), (2) financial crimes (ex: fraud, scams, money laundering), (3) property crimes (ex: theft, arson, vandalism), (4) drug crimes (ex: creating or using regulated substances), (5) weapons crimes (ex: producing unlicensed firearms), and (6) cyber crimes (ex: hacking)

**S3) Sex-Related Crimes:** Responses that enable, encourage, or endorse the commission of sex-related crimes, including: (1) sex trafficking, (2) sexual assault (ex: rape), (3) sexual harassment (physical, verbal, or visual), and (4) prostitution

**S4) Child Sexual Exploitation:** Responses that contain, describe, enable, encourage, or endorse the sexual abuse of children

**S5) Defamation:** Responses that are both verifiably false and likely to injure a living person's reputation

**S6) Specialized Advice:** Responses that contain specialized financial, medical, or legal advice, or that indicate dangerous activities or objects are safe

**S7) Privacy:** Responses that contain sensitive, nonpublic personal information that could undermine someone's physical, digital, or financial security

**S8) Intellectual Property:** Responses that may violate the intellectual property rights of any third party

**S9) Indiscriminate Weapons:** Responses that enable, encourage, or endorse the creation of indiscriminate weapons, including: (1) chemical weapons (ex: nerve gas), (2) biological weapons (ex: anthrax), (3) radiological weapons (ex: cobalt bombs), (4) nuclear weapons (ex: fission bombs), and (5) high-yield explosive weapons (ex: cluster munitions)

**S10) Hate:** Responses that demean or dehumanize people on the basis of their sensitive, personal characteristics (i.e., race, color, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, and/or serious disease)

**S11) Suicide & Self-Harm:** Responses that enable, encourage, or endorse acts of intentional self-harm, including: (1) suicide, (2) self-injury (ex: cutting), and (3) disordered eating

**S12) Sexual Content:** Responses that contain erotica

**S13) Elections:** Responses that contain factually incorrect information about electoral systems and processes, including in the time, place, or manner of voting in civic elections

**S14) Code Interpreter Abuse:** Responses that seek to abuse code interpreters, including those that enable denial of service attacks, container escapes or privilege escalation exploits

| Model ID                        | Model                          |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| groq/compound                   | [Compound](/docs/compound/systems/compound)
| groq/compound-mini              | [Compound Mini](/docs/compound/systems/compound-mini)

<br />

For a comparison between the `groq/compound` and `groq/compound-mini` systems and more information regarding extra capabilities, see the [Compound Systems](/docs/compound/systems#system-comparison) page.

## Quick Start

To use browser automation, you must enable both `browser_automation` and `web_search` tools in your request to one of the supported models. The examples below show how to access all parts of the response: the final content, reasoning process, and tool execution details.

*These examples show how to enable browser automation to get deeper search results through parallel browser control.*

<br />

When the API is called with browser automation enabled, it will launch multiple browsers to gather comprehensive information. The response includes three key components:
- **Content**: The final synthesized response from the model based on all browser sessions
- **Reasoning**: The internal decision-making process showing browser automation steps
- **Executed Tools**: Detailed information about the browser automation sessions and web searches

## How It Works

When you enable browser automation:

1. **Tool Activation**: Both `browser_automation` and `web_search` tools are enabled in your request. Browser automation will not work without both tools enabled.
2. **Parallel Browser Launch**: Up to 10 browsers are launched simultaneously to search different sources
3. **Deep Content Analysis**: Each browser navigates and extracts relevant information from multiple pages
4. **Evidence Aggregation**: Information from all browser sessions is combined and analyzed
5. **Response Generation**: The model synthesizes findings from all sources into a comprehensive response

### Final Output

This is the final response from the model, containing analysis based on information gathered from multiple browser automation sessions. The model can provide comprehensive insights, multi-source comparisons, and detailed analysis based on extensive web research.

<br />

### Why these models matter on Groq

* **Speed & Scale** – Groq’s custom LPU hardware delivers “day‑zero” inference at very low latency, so even the 120 B model can be served in near‑real‑time for interactive apps.  
* **Extended Context** – Both models can be run with up to **128 K token context length**, enabling very long documents, codebases, or conversation histories to be processed in a single request.  
* **Built‑in Tools** – GroqCloud adds **code execution** and **browser search** as first‑class capabilities, letting you augment the LLM’s output with live code runs or up‑to‑date web information without leaving the platform.  
* **Pricing** – Groq’s pricing (e.g., $0.15 / M input tokens and $0.75 / M output tokens for the 120 B model) is positioned to be competitive for high‑throughput production workloads.

### Quick “what‑to‑use‑when” guide

| Use‑case | Recommended Model |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Deep research, long‑form writing, complex code generation** | `gpt‑oss‑120B` |
| **Chatbots, summarization, classification, moderate‑size generation** | `gpt‑oss‑20B` |
| **High‑throughput, cost‑sensitive inference (e.g., batch processing, real‑time UI)** | `gpt‑oss‑20B` (or a smaller custom model if you have one) |
| **Any task that benefits from > 8 K token context** | Either model, thanks to Groq’s 128 K token support |

In short, Groq’s latest offerings are the **OpenAI open‑source models**—`gpt‑oss‑120B` and `gpt‑oss‑20B`—delivered on Groq’s ultra‑fast inference hardware, with extended context and integrated tooling that make them well‑suited for everything from heavyweight reasoning to high‑volume production AI.

### Reasoning and Internal Tool Calls

## Understanding and Optimizing Latency on Groq

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/production-readiness/optimizing-latency

# Understanding and Optimizing Latency on Groq
### Overview
Latency is a critical factor when building production applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). This guide helps you understand, measure, and optimize latency across your Groq-powered applications, providing a comprehensive foundation for production deployment.

## Understanding Latency in LLM Applications
### Key Metrics in Groq Console

Your Groq Console [dashboard](/dashboard) contains pages for metrics, usage, logs, and more. When you view your Groq API request logs, you'll see important data regarding your API requests. The following are ones relevant to latency that we'll call out and define:
<br/>
- **Time to First Token (TTFT)**: Time from API request sent to first token received from the model
- **Latency**: Total server time from API request to completion
- **Input Tokens**: Number of tokens provided to the model (e.g. system prompt, user query, assistant message), directly affecting TTFT
- **Output Tokens**: Number of tokens generated, impacting total latency
- **Tokens/Second**: Generation speed of model outputs

### The Complete Latency Picture
The users of the applications you build with APIs in general experience total latency that includes:
<br/>
`User-Experienced Latency = Network Latency + Server-side Latency`
<br/>
<small>
Server-side Latency is <a href="https://console.groq.com/dashboard/logs" target="_blank">shown in the console</a>.
</small>
<br/>

**Important**: Groq Console metrics show server-side latency only. Client-side network latency measurement examples are provided in the Network Latency Analysis section below.
<br/>
We recommend visiting [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/providers/groq) for third-party performance benchmarks across all models hosted on GroqCloud, including end-to-end response time.

## How Input Size Affects TTFT

Input token count is the primary driver of TTFT performance. Understanding this relationship allows developers to optimize prompt design and context management for predictable latency characteristics.

### The Scaling Pattern

TTFT demonstrates linear scaling characteristics across input token ranges:

- **Minimal inputs (100 tokens)**: Consistently fast TTFT across all model sizes
- **Standard contexts (1K tokens)**: TTFT remains highly responsive
- **Large contexts (10K tokens)**: TTFT increases but remains competitive
- **Maximum contexts (100K tokens)**: TTFT increases to process all the input tokens

### Model Architecture Impact on TTFT

Model architecture fundamentally determines input processing characteristics, with parameter count, attention mechanisms, and specialized capabilities creating distinct performance profiles.
<br/>
**Parameter Scaling Patterns**:
- **8B models**: Minimal TTFT variance across context lengths, optimal for latency-critical applications
- **32B models**: Linear TTFT scaling with manageable overhead for balanced workloads
- **70B and above**: Exponential TTFT increases at maximum context, requiring context management
<br/>
**Architecture-Specific Considerations**:
- **Reasoning models**: Additional computational overhead for chain-of-thought processing increases baseline latency by 10-40%
- **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: Router computation adds fixed latency cost but maintains competitive TTFT scaling
- **Vision-language models**: Image encoding preprocessing significantly impacts TTFT independent of text token count

### Model Selection Decision Tree
<br/>
```python
# Model Selection Logic

if latency_requirement == "fastest" and quality_need == "acceptable":
    return "8B_models" 
elif reasoning_required and latency_requirement != "fastest":
    return "reasoning_models"  
elif quality_need == "balanced" and latency_requirement == "balanced":
    return "32B_models" 
else:
    return "70B_models"
```

## Output Token Generation Dynamics

Sequential token generation represents the primary latency bottleneck in LLM inference. Unlike parallel input processing, each output token requires a complete forward pass through the model, creating linear scaling between output length and total generation time. Token generation demands significantly higher computational resources than input processing due to the autoregressive nature of transformer architectures.

### Architectural Performance Characteristics

Groq's LPU architecture delivers consistent generation speeds optimized for production workloads. Performance characteristics follow predictable patterns that enable reliable capacity planning and optimization decisions.
<br/>

**Generation Speed Factors**:
- **Model size**: Inverse relationship between parameter count and generation speed
- **Context length**: Quadratic attention complexity degrades speeds at extended contexts
- **Output complexity**: Mathematical reasoning and structured outputs reduce effective throughput

### Calculating End-to-End Latency
<br/>
```
Total Latency = TTFT + Decoding Time + Network Round Trip
```
<br/>
<br/>
Where:
- **TTFT** = Queueing Time + Prompt Prefill Time
- **Decoding Time** = Output Tokens / Generation Speed
- **Network Round Trip** = Client-to-server communication overhead
## Infrastructure Optimization

### Network Latency Analysis

Network latency can significantly impact user-experienced performance. If client-measured total latency substantially exceeds server-side metrics returned in API responses, network optimization becomes critical.
<br/>
**Diagnostic Approach**:

**Response Header Analysis**:

The `x-groq-region` header confirms which datacenter processed your request, enabling latency correlation with geographic proximity. This information helps you understand if your requests are being routed to the optimal datacenter for your location.

### Context Length Management

As shown above, TTFT scales with input length. End users can employ several prompting strategies to optimize context usage and reduce latency:

- **Prompt Chaining**: Decompose complex tasks into sequential subtasks where each prompt's output feeds the next. This technique reduces individual prompt length while maintaining context flow. Example: First prompt extracts relevant quotes from documents, second prompt answers questions using those quotes. Improves transparency and enables easier debugging.

- **Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot Selection**: For concise, well-defined tasks, zero-shot prompting ("Classify this sentiment") minimizes context length while leveraging model capabilities. Reserve few-shot examples only when task-specific patterns are essential, as examples consume significant tokens.

- **Strategic Context Prioritization**: Place critical information at prompt beginning or end, as models perform best with information in these positions. Use clear separators (triple quotes, headers) to structure complex prompts and help models focus on relevant sections.

<br/>
For detailed implementation strategies and examples, consult the [Groq Prompt Engineering Documentation](/docs/prompting) and [Prompting Patterns Guide](/docs/prompting/patterns).

## Groq's Processing Options

### Service Tier Architecture

Groq offers three service tiers that influence latency characteristics and processing behavior:
<br/>

**On-Demand Processing** (`"service_tier":"on_demand"`): For real-time applications requiring guaranteed processing, the standard API delivers:
- Industry-leading low latency with consistent performance
- Streaming support for immediate perceived response
- Controlled rate limits to ensure fairness and consistent experience

**Flex Processing** (`"service_tier":"flex"`): [Flex Processing](/docs/flex-processing) optimizes for throughput with higher request volumes in exchange for occasional failures. Flex processing gives developers 10x their current rate limits, as system capacity allows, with rapid timeouts when resources are constrained.

_Best for_: High-volume workloads, content pipelines, variable demand spikes.
<br/>
**Auto Processing** (`"service_tier":"auto"`): Auto Processing uses on-demand rate limits initially, then automatically falls back to flex tier processing if those limits are exceeded. This provides optimal balance between guaranteed processing and high throughput.

_Best for_: Applications requiring both reliability and scalability during demand spikes.

### Processing Tier Selection Logic

```python
# Processing Tier Selection Logic  

if real_time_required and throughput_need != "high":
    return "on_demand"  
elif throughput_need == "high" and cost_priority != "critical":
    return "flex"  
elif real_time_required and throughput_need == "variable":
    return "auto"  
elif cost_priority == "critical":
    return "batch"  
else:
    return "on_demand" 
```

### Batch Processing

[Batch Processing](/docs/batch) enables cost-effective asynchronous processing with a completion window, optimized for scenarios where immediate responses aren't required.
<br/> 
**Batch API Overview**: The Groq Batch API processes large-scale workloads asynchronously, offering significant advantages for high-volume use cases:

- **Higher rate limits**: Process thousands of requests per batch with no impact on standard API rate limits
- **Cost efficiency**: 50% cost discount compared to synchronous APIs
- **Flexible processing windows**: 24-hour to 7-day completion timeframes based on workload requirements
- **Rate limit isolation**: Batch processing doesn't consume your standard API quotas

<br/>
**Latency Considerations**: While batch processing trades immediate response for efficiency, understanding its latency characteristics helps optimize workload planning:

- **Submission latency**: Minimal overhead for batch job creation and validation
- **Queue processing**: Variable based on system load and batch size
- **Completion notification**: Webhook or polling-based status updates
- **Result retrieval**: Standard API latency for downloading completed outputs

<br/>
**Optimal Use Cases**: Batch processing excels for workloads where processing time flexibility enables significant cost and throughput benefits: large dataset analysis, content generation pipelines, model evaluation suites, and scheduled data enrichment tasks.

## Streaming Implementation

### Server-Sent Events Best Practices

Implement streaming to improve perceived latency:
<br/>

**Streaming Implementation**:

```python
import os
from groq import Groq

def stream_response(prompt):
    client = Groq(api_key=os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY"))
    stream = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        stream=True
    )
    
    for chunk in stream:
        if chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
            yield chunk.choices[0].delta.content

# Example usage with concrete prompt
prompt = "Write a short story about a robot learning to paint in exactly 3 sentences."
for token in stream_response(prompt):
    print(token, end='', flush=True)
```

```javascript
import Groq from "groq-sdk";

async function streamResponse(prompt) {
    const groq = new Groq({
        apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY
    });
    
    const stream = await groq.chat.completions.create({
        model: "meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct",
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
        stream: true
    });

    for await (const chunk of stream) {
        if (chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content) {
            process.stdout.write(chunk.choices[0].delta.content);
        }
    }
}

// Example usage with concrete prompt
const prompt = "Write a short story about a robot learning to paint in exactly 3 sentences.";
streamResponse(prompt);
```
<br/>
**Key Benefits**:
- Users see immediate response initiation
- Better user engagement and experience
- Error handling during generation

_Best for_: Interactive applications requiring immediate feedback, user-facing chatbots, real-time content generation where perceived responsiveness is critical.

## Security Onboarding

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/production-readiness/security-onboarding

# Security Onboarding

Welcome to the **Groq Security Onboarding** guide.  
This page walks through best practices for protecting your API keys, securing client configurations, and hardening integrations before moving into production.

## Overview

Security is a shared responsibility between Groq and our customers.  
While Groq ensures secure API transport and service isolation, customers are responsible for securing client-side configurations, keys, and data handling.

All Groq API traffic is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2+ and authenticated via API keys.

## Secure API Key Management

Never expose or hardcode API keys directly into your source code.  
Use environment variables or a secret management system.

**Warning:** Never embed keys in frontend code or expose them in browser bundles. If you need client-side usage, route through a trusted backend proxy.

## Key Rotation & Revocation

* Rotate API keys periodically (e.g., quarterly).
* Revoke keys immediately if compromise is suspected.
* Use per-environment keys (dev / staging / prod).
* Log all API key creations and deletions.

## Transport Security (TLS)

Groq APIs enforce HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or higher).
You should **never** disable SSL verification.

## Input and Prompt Safety

When integrating Groq into user-facing systems, ensure that user inputs cannot trigger prompt injection or tool misuse.

**Recommendations:**

* Sanitize user input before embedding in prompts.
* Avoid exposing internal system instructions or hidden context.
* Validate model outputs (especially JSON / code / commands).
* Limit model access to safe tools or actions only.

## Rate Limiting and Retry Logic

Implement client-side rate limiting and exponential backoff for 429 / 5xx responses.

## Logging & Monitoring

Maintain structured logs for all API interactions.

**Include:**

* Timestamp
* Endpoint
* Request latency
* Key / service ID (non-secret)
* Error codes

**Tip:** Avoid logging sensitive data or raw model responses containing user information.

## Secure Tool Use & Agent Integrations

When using Groq's **Tool Use** or external function execution features:

* Expose only vetted, sandboxed tools.
* Restrict external network calls.
* Audit all registered tools and permissions.
* Validate arguments and outputs.

## Incident Response

If you suspect your API key is compromised:

1. Revoke the key immediately from the [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys).
2. Rotate to a new key and redeploy secrets.
3. Review logs for suspicious activity.
4. Notify your security admin.

**Warning:** Never reuse compromised keys, even temporarily.

## Quickstart

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/quickstart

# Quickstart

Get up and running with the Groq API in a few minutes, with the steps below.

For additional support, catch our [onboarding video](/docs/overview).

## Create an API Key

Please visit [here](/keys) to create an API Key.

## Set up your API Key (recommended)

Configure your API key as an environment variable. This approach streamlines your API usage by eliminating the need to include your API key in each request. Moreover, it enhances security by minimizing the risk of inadvertently including your API key in your codebase.

### In your terminal of choice:

```shell
export GROQ_API_KEY=<your-api-key-here>
```

## Requesting your first chat completion

### Execute this curl command in the terminal of your choice:

```shell
# (example shell script)
```

### Install the Groq JavaScript library:

```shell
# (example shell script)
```

### Performing a Chat Completion:

```js
// (example JavaScript code)
```

### Install the Groq Python library:

```shell
# (example shell script)
```

### Performing a Chat Completion:

```python
# (example Python code)
```

### Pass the following as the request body:

```json
// (example JSON data)
```

## Using third-party libraries and SDKs

### Using AI SDK:

[AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) is a Javascript-based open-source library that simplifies building large language model (LLM) applications. Documentation for how to use Groq on the AI SDK [can be found here](https://console.groq.com/docs/ai-sdk/).

<br />

First, install the `ai` package and the Groq provider `@ai-sdk/groq`:

<br />

```shell
pnpm add ai @ai-sdk/groq
```

<br />

Then, you can use the Groq provider to generate text. By default, the provider will look for `GROQ_API_KEY` as the API key.

<br />

```js
// (example JavaScript code)
```

### Using LiteLLM:

[LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/) is both a Python-based open-source library, and a proxy/gateway server  that simplifies building large language model (LLM) applications. Documentation for LiteLLM [can be found here](https://docs.litellm.ai/).

<br />

First, install the `litellm` package:

<br />

```python
pip install litellm
```

<br />

Then, set up your API key:

<br />

```python
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
```

<br />

Now you can easily use any model from Groq. Just set `model=groq/<any-model-on-groq>` as a prefix when sending litellm requests.

<br />

```python
# (example Python code)
```

### Using LangChain:

[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is a framework for developing reliable agents and applications powered by large language models (LLMs). Documentation for LangChain [can be found here for Python](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/), and [here for Javascript](https://js.langchain.com/docs/introduction/).

<br />

When using Python, first, install the `langchain` package:

<br />

```python
pip install langchain-groq
```

<br />

Then, set up your API key:

<br />

```python
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
```

<br />

Now you can build chains and agents that can perform multi-step tasks. This chain combines a prompt that tells the model what information to extract, a parser that ensures the output follows a specific JSON format, and llama-3.3-70b-versatile to do the actual text processing.

<br />

```python
# (example Python code)
```

Now that you have successfully received a chat completion, you can try out the other endpoints in the API.

# Structured Outputs

Guarantee model responses strictly conform to your JSON schema for reliable, type-safe data structures.

## Introduction
Structured Outputs is a feature that makes your model responses strictly conform to your provided [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/overview/what-is-jsonschema) or throws an error if the model cannot produce a compliant response. The endpoint provides customers with the ability to obtain reliable data structures.

 

This feature's performance is dependent on the model's ability to produce a valid answer that matches your schema. If the model fails to generate a conforming response, the endpoint will return an error rather than an invalid or incomplete result.

 

Key benefits:

1. **Binary output:** Either returns valid JSON Schema-compliant output or throws an error
2. **Type-safe responses:** No need to validate or retry malformed outputs
3. **Programmatic refusal detection:** Detect safety-based model refusals programmatically
4. **Simplified prompting:** No complex prompts needed for consistent formatting

 

In addition to supporting Structured Outputs in our API, our SDKs also enable you to easily define your schemas with [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) and [Zod](https://zod.dev/) to ensure further type safety. The examples below show how to extract structured information from unstructured text.

## Supported models

Structured Outputs is available with the following models:

| Model ID                        | Model                          |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `openai/gpt-oss-20b`                  | [GPT-OSS 20B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-20b)
| `openai/gpt-oss-120b`                  | [GPT-OSS 120B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-120b)
| `openai/gpt-oss-safeguard-20b`                  | [Safety GPT OSS 20B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-safeguard-20b)
| `moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct-0905`                  | [Kimi K2 Instruct](/docs/model/moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct-0905)
| `meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct` | [Llama 4 Maverick](/docs/model/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct)
| `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` | [Llama 4 Scout](/docs/model/meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct)

 

For all other models, you can use [JSON Object Mode](#json-object-mode) to get a valid JSON object, though it may not match your schema.

 

**Note:** [streaming](/docs/text-chat#streaming-a-chat-completion) and [tool use](/docs/tool-use) are not currently supported with Structured Outputs.

### Getting a structured response from unstructured text


### SQL Query Generation

You can generate structured SQL queries from natural language descriptions, helping ensure proper syntax and including metadata about the query structure.

 

**Example Output**

```json
{
    "query": "SELECT c.name, c.email, SUM(o.total_amount) as total_order_amount FROM customers c JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id WHERE o.order_date >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY) AND o.total_amount > 500 GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name, c.email ORDER BY total_order_amount DESC",
    "query_type": "SELECT",
    "tables_used": ["customers", "orders"],
    "estimated_complexity": "medium",
    "execution_notes": [
      "Query uses JOIN to connect customers and orders tables",
      "DATE_SUB function calculates 30 days ago from current date",
      "GROUP BY aggregates orders per customer",
      "Results ordered by total order amount descending"
    ],
    "validation_status": {
      "is_valid": true,
      "syntax_errors": []
    }
}
```

### Email Classification

You can classify emails into structured categories with confidence scores, priority levels, and suggested actions.

 

**Example Output**

```json
{
    "category": "urgent",
    "priority": "critical",
    "confidence_score": 0.95,
    "sentiment": "negative",
    "key_entities": [
        {
          "entity": "production server",
          "type": "system"
        },
        {
          "entity": "2:30 PM EST",
          "type": "datetime"
        },
        {
          "entity": "DevOps Team",
          "type": "organization"
        },
        {
          "entity": "customer-facing services",
          "type": "system"
        }
    ],
    "suggested_actions": [
        "Join emergency call immediately",
        "Escalate to senior DevOps team",
        "Activate incident response protocol",
        "Prepare customer communication",
        "Monitor service restoration progress"
    ],
    "requires_immediate_attention": true,
    "estimated_response_time": "immediate"
}
```

### API Response Validation

You can validate and structure API responses with error handling, status codes, and standardized data formats for reliable integration.

 

**Example Output**

```json
{
    "validation_result": {
        "is_valid": false,
        "status_code": 400,
        "error_count": 2
    },
    "field_validations": [
        {
            "field_name": "user_id",
            "field_type": "string",
            "is_valid": true,
            "error_message": "",
            "expected_format": "string"
        },
        {
            "field_name": "email",
            "field_type": "string",
            "is_valid": false,
            "error_message": "Invalid email format",
            "expected_format": "valid email address (e.g., user@example.com)"
        }
    ],
    "data_quality_score": 0.7,
    "suggested_fixes": [
        "Fix email format validation to ensure proper email structure",
        "Add proper error handling structure to response"
    ],
    "compliance_check": {
        "follows_rest_standards": false,
        "has_proper_error_handling": false,
        "includes_metadata": false
    }
}
```

## Schema Validation Libraries

When working with Structured Outputs, you can use popular schema validation libraries like [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for TypeScript and [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) for Python. These libraries provide type safety, runtime validation, and seamless integration with JSON Schema generation.

### Support Ticket Classification

This example demonstrates how to classify customer support tickets using structured schemas with both Zod and Pydantic, ensuring consistent categorization and routing.

 

**Example Output**

```json
{
    "category": "feature_request",
    "priority": "low",
    "urgency_score": 2.5,
    "customer_info": {
        "name": "Mike",
        "company": "StartupXYZ",
        "tier": "paid"
    },
    "technical_details": [
        {
            "component": "dashboard",
            "description": "Request for dark mode feature"
        },
        {
            "component": "user_interface",
            "description": "Request for keyboard shortcuts"
        }
    ],
    "keywords": ["dark mode", "dashboard", "keyboard shortcuts", "enhancement"],
    "requires_escalation": false,
    "estimated_resolution_hours": 40,
    "summary": "Feature request for dark mode and keyboard shortcuts from paying customer"
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Schema Definition

Design your JSON Schema to constrain model responses. Reference the [examples](#examples) above and see [supported schema features](#schema-requirements) for technical limitations.

 

**Schema optimization tips:**
- Use descriptive property names and clear descriptions for complex fields
- Create evaluation sets to test schema effectiveness
- Include titles for important structural elements

### API Integration

Include the schema in your API request using the `response_format` parameter:

```json
response_format: { type: "json_schema", json_schema: { name: "schema_name", schema: … } }
```

 

Complete implementation example:

### Error Handling

Schema validation failures return HTTP 400 errors with the message `Generated JSON does not match the expected schema. Please adjust your prompt.`

 

**Resolution strategies:**
- Retry requests for transient failures
- Refine prompts for recurring schema mismatches
- Simplify complex schemas if validation consistently fails

### Best Practices

**User input handling:** Include explicit instructions for invalid or incompatible inputs. Models attempt schema adherence even with unrelated data, potentially causing hallucinations. Specify fallback responses (empty fields, error messages) for incompatible inputs.

 

**Output quality:** Structured outputs are designed to output schema compliance but not semantic accuracy. For persistent errors, refine instructions, add system message examples, or decompose complex tasks. See the [prompt engineering guide](/docs/prompting) for optimization techniques.

## Schema Requirements

Structured Outputs supports a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/docs) subset with specific constraints for performance and reliability.

### Supported Data Types

- **Primitives:** String, Number, Boolean, Integer
- **Complex:** Object, Array, Enum
- **Composition:** anyOf (union types)

### Mandatory Constraints

**Required fields:** All schema properties must be marked as `required`. Optional fields are not supported.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {"type": "string"},
    "age": {"type": "integer"}
  },
  "required": ["name", "age"]
}
```

**Closed objects:** All objects must set `additionalProperties: false` to prevent undefined properties. This ensures strict schema adherence.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {"type": "string"},
    "age": {"type": "integer"}
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Union types:** Each schema within `anyOf` must comply with all subset restrictions:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "payment_method": {
      "anyOf": [
        {"type": "string", "enum": ["credit_card", "paypal"]},
        {"type": "null"}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Reusable subschemas:** Define reusable components with `$defs` and reference them using `$ref`:

```json
{
  "$defs": {
    "address": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "street": {"type": "string"},
        "city": {"type": "string"}
      },
      "required": ["street", "city"]
    }
  },
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "billing_address": {"$ref": "#/$defs/address"}
  }
}
```

**Root recursion:** Use `#` to reference the root schema:

```json
{
  "$ref": "#"
}
```

**Explicit recursion** through definition references:

```json
{
  "$defs": {
    "tree": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "branches": {"type": "array", "items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/tree"}}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## JSON Object Mode

JSON Object Mode provides basic JSON output validation without schema enforcement. Unlike Structured Outputs with `json_schema` mode, it is designed to output valid JSON syntax but not schema compliance. The endpoint will either return valid JSON or throw an error if the model cannot produce valid JSON syntax. Use [Structured Outputs](#introduction) when available for your use case.

 

Enable JSON Object Mode by setting `response_format` to `{ "type": "json_object" }`.

 

**Requirements and limitations:**
- Include explicit JSON instructions in your prompt (system message or user input)
- Outputs are syntactically valid JSON but may not match your intended schema
- Combine with validation libraries and retry logic for schema compliance

### Sentiment Analysis Example

This example shows prompt-guided JSON generation for sentiment analysis, adaptable to classification, extraction, or summarization tasks:

**Example Output**

```json
{
    "sentiment_analysis": {
      "sentiment": "positive",
      "confidence_score": 0.84,
      "key_phrases": [
          {
              "phrase": "absolutely love this product",
              "sentiment": "positive"
          },
          {
              "phrase": "quality exceeded my expectations",
              "sentiment": "positive"
          }
      ],
      "summary": "The reviewer loves the product's quality, but was slightly disappointed with the shipping time."
    }
}
```

**Response structure:**
- **sentiment**: Classification (positive/negative/neutral) 
- **confidence_score**: Confidence level (0-1 scale)
- **key_phrases**: Extracted phrases with individual sentiment scores
- **summary**: Analysis overview and main findings

## Speech to Text

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/speech-to-text

# Speech to Text
Groq API is designed to provide fast speech-to-text solution available, offering OpenAI-compatible endpoints that
enable near-instant transcriptions and translations. With Groq API, you can integrate high-quality audio 
processing into your applications at speeds that rival human interaction. 

## API Endpoints

We support two endpoints:

| Endpoint       | Usage                          | API Endpoint                                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Transcriptions | Convert audio to text          | `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/audio/transcriptions`        |
| Translations   | Translate audio to English text| `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/audio/translations`          |

## Supported Models

| Model ID                    | Model                | Supported Language(s)          | Description                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `whisper-large-v3-turbo`    | [Whisper Large V3 Turbo](/docs/model/whisper-large-v3-turbo) | Multilingual                | A fine-tuned version of a pruned Whisper Large V3 designed for fast, multilingual transcription tasks. |
| `whisper-large-v3`          | [Whisper Large V3](/docs/model/whisper-large-v3)     | Multilingual                  | Provides state-of-the-art performance with high accuracy for multilingual transcription and translation tasks. |

  
## Which Whisper Model Should You Use?
Having more choices is great, but let's try to avoid decision paralysis by breaking down the tradeoffs between models to find the one most suitable for
your applications: 
- If your application is error-sensitive and requires multilingual support, use `whisper-large-v3`. 
- If your application requires multilingual support and you need the best price for performance, use `whisper-large-v3-turbo`. 

The following table breaks down the metrics for each model.
| Model | Cost Per Hour | Language Support | Transcription Support | Translation Support | Real-time Speed Factor | Word Error Rate |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| `whisper-large-v3` | $0.111 | Multilingual | Yes | Yes | 189 | 10.3% |
| `whisper-large-v3-turbo` | $0.04 | Multilingual | Yes | No | 216 | 12% |


## Working with Audio Files

### Audio File Limitations

* Max File Size: 25 MB (free tier), 100MB (dev tier)
* Max Attachment File Size: 25 MB. If you need to process larger files, use the `url` parameter to specify a url to the file instead.
* Minimum File Length: 0.01 seconds
* Minimum Billed Length: 10 seconds. If you submit a request less than this, you will still be billed for 10 seconds.
* Supported File Types: Either a URL or a direct file upload for `flac`, `mp3`, `mp4`, `mpeg`, `mpga`, `m4a`, `ogg`, `wav`, `webm`
* Single Audio Track: Only the first track will be transcribed for files with multiple audio tracks. (e.g. dubbed video)
* Supported Response Formats: `json`, `verbose_json`, `text`
* Supported Timestamp Granularities: `segment`, `word`

### Audio Preprocessing
Our speech-to-text models will downsample audio to 16KHz mono before transcribing, which is optimal for speech recognition. This preprocessing can be performed client-side if your original file is extremely 
large and you want to make it smaller without a loss in quality (without chunking, Groq API speech-to-text endpoints accept up to 25MB for free tier and 100MB for [dev tier](/settings/billing)). For lower latency, convert your files to `wav` format. When reducing file size, we recommend FLAC for lossless compression.

The following `ffmpeg` command can be used to reduce file size:

```shell
ffmpeg \
  -i <your file> \
  -ar 16000 \
  -ac 1 \
  -map 0:a \
  -c:a flac \
  <output file name>.flac
```

### Working with Larger Audio Files
For audio files that exceed our size limits or require more precise control over transcription, we recommend implementing audio chunking. This process involves:
1. Breaking the audio into smaller, overlapping segments
2. Processing each segment independently
3. Combining the results while handling overlapping

[To learn more about this process and get code for your own implementation, see the complete audio chunking tutorial in our Groq API Cookbook.](https://github.com/groq/groq-api-cookbook/tree/main/tutorials/audio-chunking)

## Using the API 
The following are request parameters you can use in your transcription and translation requests:
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | `string` | Required unless using `url` instead | The audio file object for direct upload to translate/transcribe. |
| `url` | `string` | Required unless using `file` instead | The audio URL to translate/transcribe (supports Base64URL). |
| `language` | `string` | Optional | The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 (i.e. `en, `tr`) format will improve accuracy and latency.<br/><br/>The translations endpoint only supports 'en' as a parameter option. |
| `model` | `string` | Required | ID of the model to use.|
| `prompt` | `string` | Optional | Prompt to guide the model's style or specify how to spell unfamiliar words. (limited to 224 tokens) |
| `response_format` | `string` | json | Define the output response format.<br/><br/>Set to `verbose_json` to receive timestamps for audio segments.<br/><br/>Set to `text` to return a text response. |
| `temperature` | `float` | 0 | The temperature between 0 and 1. For translations and transcriptions, we recommend the default value of 0. |
| `timestamp_granularities[]` | `array` | segment | The timestamp granularities to populate for this transcription. `response_format` must be set `verbose_json` to use timestamp granularities.<br/><br/>Either or both of `word` and `segment` are supported. <br/><br/>`segment` returns full metadata and `word` returns only word, start, and end timestamps. To get both word-level timestamps and full segment metadata, include both values in the array. |

The following code snippet demonstrates how to use Groq API to translate an audio file in JavaScript:

```javascript
// JavaScript code snippet for translation
```

The following is an example cURL request:

```shell
# cURL request example
```

The following is an example response:

```json
{
  "text": "Your translated text appears here...",
  "x_groq": {
    "id": "req_unique_id"
  }
}
```

## Understanding Metadata Fields
When working with Groq API, setting `response_format` to `verbose_json` outputs each segment of transcribed text with valuable metadata that helps us understand the quality and characteristics of our 
transcription, including `avg_logprob`, `compression_ratio`, and `no_speech_prob`. 

This information can help us with debugging any transcription issues. Let's examine what this metadata tells us using a real 
example:

```json
{
  "id": 8,
  "seek": 3000,
  "start": 43.92,
  "end": 50.16,
  "text": " document that the functional specification that you started to read through that isn't just the",
  "tokens": [51061, 4166, 300, 264, 11745, 31256],
  "temperature": 0,
  "avg_logprob": -0.097569615,
  "compression_ratio": 1.6637554,
  "no_speech_prob": 0.012814695
}
```

As shown in the above example, we receive timing information as well as quality indicators. Let's gain a better understanding of what each field means:
- `id:8`: The 9th segment in the transcription (counting begins at 0)
- `seek`: Indicates where in the audio file this segment begins (3000 in this case)
- `start` and `end` timestamps: Tell us exactly when this segment occurs in the audio (43.92 to 50.16 seconds in our example)
- `avg_logprob` (Average Log Probability): -0.097569615 in our example indicates very high confidence. Values closer to 0 suggest better confidence, while more negative values (like -0.5 or lower) might 
indicate transcription issues.
- `no_speech_prob` (No Speech Probability): 0.0.012814695 is very low, suggesting this is definitely speech. Higher values (closer to 1) would indicate potential silence or non-speech audio.
- `compression_ratio`: 1.6637554 is a healthy value, indicating normal speech patterns. Unusual values (very high or low) might suggest issues with speech clarity or word boundaries.

### Using Metadata for Debugging
When troubleshooting transcription issues, look for these patterns:
- Low Confidence Sections: If `avg_logprob` drops significantly (becomes more negative), check for background noise, multiple speakers talking simultaneously, unclear pronunciation, and strong accents. 
Consider cleaning up the audio in these sections or adjusting chunk sizes around problematic chunk boundaries.
- Non-Speech Detection: High `no_speech_prob` values might indicate silence periods that could be trimmed, background music or noise, or non-verbal sounds being misinterpreted as speech. Consider noise 
reduction when preprocessing.
- Unusual Speech Patterns: Unexpected `compression_ratio` values can reveal stuttering or word repetition, speaker talking unusually fast or slow, or audio quality issues affecting word separation.

### Quality Thresholds and Regular Monitoring
We recommend setting acceptable ranges for each metadata value we reviewed above and flagging segments that fall outside these ranges to be able to identify and adjust preprocessing or chunking strategies for 
flagged sections. 

By understanding and monitoring these metadata values, you can significantly improve your transcription quality and quickly identify potential issues in your audio processing pipeline. 


## Prompting Guidelines
  The prompt parameter (max 224 tokens) helps provide context and maintain a consistent output style.
  Unlike chat completion prompts, these prompts only guide style and context, not specific actions.

  ### Best Practices

  - Provide relevant context about the audio content, such as the type of conversation, topic, or 
    speakers involved.
  - Use the same language as the language of the audio file.
  - Steer the model's output by denoting proper spellings or emulate a specific writing style or tone.
  - Keep the prompt concise and focused on stylistic guidance.

We can't wait to see what you build!

## Agno + Groq: Fast Agents

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/agno

## Agno + Groq: Fast Agents

[Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno) is a lightweight framework for building multi-modal Agents. It's easy to use, extremely fast and supports multi-modal inputs and outputs.

With Groq & Agno, you can build:

- **Agentic RAG**: Agents that can search different knowledge stores for RAG or dynamic few-shot learning.
- **Image Agents**: Agents that can understand images and make tool calls accordingly.
- **Reasoning Agents**: Agents that can reason using a reasoning model, then generate a result using another model.
- **Structured Outputs**: Agents that can generate pydantic objects adhering to a schema.

### Python Quick Start (2 minutes to hello world)

Agents are autonomous programs that use language models to achieve tasks. They solve problems by running tools, accessing knowledge and memory to improve responses.

Let's build a simple web search agent, with a tool to search DuckDuckGo to get better results. 

#### 1. Create a file called `web_search_agent.py` and add the following code:
```python web_search_agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.groq import Groq
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

# Initialize the agent with an LLM via Groq and DuckDuckGoTools
agent = Agent(
    model=Groq(id="llama-3.3-70b-versatile"),
    description="You are an enthusiastic news reporter with a flair for storytelling!",
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],      # Add DuckDuckGo tool to search the web
    show_tool_calls=True,           # Shows tool calls in the response, set to False to hide
    markdown=True                   # Format responses in markdown
)

# Prompt the agent to fetch a breaking news story from New York
agent.print_response("Tell me about a breaking news story from New York.", stream=True)
```

#### 3. Set up and activate your virtual environment:
```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### 4. Install the Groq, Agno, and DuckDuckGo dependencies:
```shell
pip install -U groq agno duckduckgo-search
```

#### 5. Configure your Groq API Key:
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

#### 6. Run your Agno agent that now extends your LLM's context to include web search for up-to-date information and send results in seconds:
```shell
python web_search_agent.py
```

### Multi-Agent Teams
Agents work best when they have a singular purpose, a narrow scope, and a small number of tools. When the number of tools grows beyond what the language model can handle or the tools belong to different 
categories, use a **team of agents** to spread the load.

The following code expands upon our quick start and creates a team of two agents to provide analysis on financial markets:
```python agent_team.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.groq import Groq
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

web_agent = Agent(
    name="Web Agent",
    role="Search the web for information",
    model=Groq(id="llama-3.3-70b-versatile"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    instructions="Always include sources",
    markdown=True,
)

finance_agent = Agent(
    name="Finance Agent",
    role="Get financial data",
    model=Groq(id="llama-3.3-70b-versatile"),
    tools=[YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True)],
    instructions="Use tables to display data",
    markdown=True,
)

agent_team = Agent(
    team=[web_agent, finance_agent],
    model=Groq(id="llama-3.3-70b-versatile"),  # You can use a different model for the team leader agent
    instructions=["Always include sources", "Use tables to display data"],
    # show_tool_calls=True,  # Uncomment to see tool calls in the response
    markdown=True,
)

# Give the team a task
agent_team.print_response("What's the market outlook and financial performance of AI semiconductor companies?", stream=True)
```

## Prometheus Metrics

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/prometheus-metrics

# Prometheus Metrics

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is an open-source monitoring system that collects and stores metrics as time series data.
Its [stable API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/) is compatible with a range of systems and tools like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana).

## Enterprise Feature

This feature is only available to our Enterprise tier customers. To get started, please reach out to [our Enterprise team](https://groq.com/enterprise-access).

## APIs

Groq exposes Prometheus metrics about your organization's usage through [VictoriaMetrics](https://victoriametrics.com/). It [supports](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/#prometheus-querying-api-usage) most Prometheus querying API paths:

* `/api/v1/query`
* `/api/v1/query_range`
* `/api/v1/series`
* `/api/v1/labels`
* `/api/v1/label/<label_name>/values`
* `/api/v1/status/tsdb`


## MetricsQL

Prometheus queries against Groq endpoints use [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html), a query language that extends Prometheus's native [PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) query language.

## Querying

Queries can be sent to the following endpoint:

```
https://api.groq.com/v1/metrics/prometheus
```

To Authenticate, you will need to provide your Groq API key as a header in the `Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>` format.

## Grafana

If you run Grafana, you can add Groq metrics as a Prometheus datasource:

1. Add a new Prometheus datasource in Grafana by navigating to Settings -> Data Sources -> Add data source -> Prometheus.
2. Enter the following URL under HTTP -> URL: `https://api.groq.com/v1/metrics/prometheus`
3. Set the `Authorization` header to your Groq API key:
  * Go to Custom HTTP Headers -> Add Header
    * Header: `Authorization`
    * Value: `Bearer <your-api-key>`
4. Save & Test.

## Available Metrics

Groq provides the following metrics:

### Request Metrics
* `requests:increase1m`
  * The number of requests made within a minute
* `requests:rate1m`
  * The average number of requests per second over a given minute

Broken out by `model` and `status_code`

### Latency Metrics
* `e2e_latency_seconds:{percentile}:rate5m`
  * Percentile end-to-end latency average over a 5 minute window for P99, P95, and P50
* `ttft_latency_seconds:{percentile}:rate5m`
  * Percentile time to first token latency average over a 5 minute window for P99, P95, and P50
* `queue_latency_seconds:{percentile}:rate5m`
  * Percentile queue latency (time request spends in queue before being processed) average over a 5 minute window for P99, P95, and P50

Broken out by `model`.

### Token Metrics
* `tokens_in:{percentile}:rate5m`
  * Percentile number of input tokens average over a 5 minute window for P99, P95, and P50
* `tokens_out:{percentile}:rate5m`
  * Percentile number of output tokens average over a 5 minute window for P99, P95, and P50

Broken out by `model`.

In addition to using the APIs directly, you can see a handful of curated charts directly in our console at [Metrics](/metrics/prometheus)

## Groq Batch API

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/batch

# Groq Batch API
Process large-scale workloads asynchronously with our Batch API. 

## What is Batch Processing?
Batch processing lets you run thousands of API requests at scale by submitting your workload as an asynchronous batch of requests to Groq with 50% lower cost, no impact to your standard rate limits, and 24-hour to 7 day processing window.

## Overview
While some of your use cases may require synchronous API requests, asynchronous batch processing is perfect for use cases that don't need immediate reponses or for processing a large number of queries that standard rate limits cannot handle, such as processing large datasets, generating content in bulk, and running evaluations.

Compared to using our synchronous API endpoints, our Batch API has:
- **Higher rate limits:** Process thousands of requests per batch with no impact on your standard API rate limits
- **Cost efficiency:** 50% cost discount compared to synchronous APIs

## Model Availability and Pricing
The Batch API can currently be used to execute queries for chat completion (both text and vision), audio transcription, and audio translation inputs with the following models:

| Model ID                        | Model                          |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|

## Getting Started
Our Batch API endpoints allow you to collect a group of requests into a single file, kick off a batch processing job to execute the requests within your file, query for the status of your batch, and eventually 
retrieve the results when your batch is complete.

Multiple batch jobs can be submitted at once.

Each batch has a processing window, during which we'll process as many requests as our capacity allows while maintaining service quality for all users. We allow for setting 
a batch window from 24 hours to 7 days and recommend setting a longer batch window allow us more time to complete your batch jobs instead of expiring them.

### 1. Prepare Your Batch File
A batch is composed of a list of API requests and every batch job starts with a JSON Lines (JSONL) file that contains the requests
you want processed. Each line in this file represents a single API call.

The Groq Batch API currently supports:
- Chat completion requests through `/v1/chat/completions`
- Audio transcription requests through `/v1/audio/transcriptions`
- Audio translation requests through `/v1/audio/translations`

The structure for each line must include:
- `custom_id`: Your unique identifier for tracking the batch request
- `method`: The HTTP method (currently `POST` only)
- `url`: The API endpoint to call (one of: `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/audio/transcriptions`, or `/v1/audio/translations`)
- `body`: The parameters of your request matching our synchronous API format.

The following is an example of a JSONL batch file with different types of requests:

```json
{"custom_id": "request-1", "method": "POST", "url": "/v1/chat/completions", "body": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is 2+2?"}]}}
{"custom_id": "request-2", "method": "POST", "url": "/v1/chat/completions", "body": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is 2+3?"}]}}
{"custom_id": "request-3", "method": "POST", "url": "/v1/chat/completions", "body": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "count up to 1000000. starting with 1, 2, 3. print all the numbers, do not stop until you get to 1000000."}]}}
```

#### Converting Sync Calls to Batch Format 
If you're familiar with making synchronous API calls, converting them to batch format is straightforward. Here's how a regular API call transforms
into a batch request:

```json
# Your typical synchronous API call in Python:
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llama-3.1-8b-instant",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is quantum computing?"}
    ]
)

# The same call in batch format (must be on a single line as JSONL):
{"custom_id": "quantum-1", "method": "POST", "url": "/v1/chat/completions", "body": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is quantum computing?"}]}}
```

### 2. Upload Your Batch File
Upload your `.jsonl` batch file using the Files API endpoint for when kicking off your batch job.

**Note:** The Files API currently only supports `.jsonl` files 50,000 lines or less and up to maximum of 200MB in size. There is no limit for the 
number of batch jobs you can submit. We recommend submitting multiple shorter batch files for a better chance of completion.

You will receive a JSON response that contains the ID (`id`) for your file object that you will then use to create your batch job:
```json
{
    "id":"file_01jh6x76wtemjr74t1fh0faj5t",
    "object":"file",
    "bytes":966,
    "created_at":1736472501,
    "filename":"input_file.jsonl",
    "purpose":"batch"
}
```

### 3. Create Your Batch Job 
Once you've uploaded your `.jsonl` file, you can use the file object ID (in this case, `file_01jh6x76wtemjr74t1fh0faj5t` as shown in Step 2) to create a batch: 

**Note:** The completion window for batch jobs can be set from to 24 hours (`24h`) to 7 days (`7d`). We recommend setting a longer batch window 
to have a better chance for completed batch jobs rather than expirations for when we are under heavy load.

This request will return a Batch object with metadata about your batch, including the batch `id` that you can use to check the status of your batch:
```json
{
    "id":"batch_01jh6xa7reempvjyh6n3yst2zw",
    "object":"batch",
    "endpoint":"/v1/chat/completions",
    "errors":null,
    "input_file_id":"file_01jh6x76wtemjr74t1fh0faj5t",
    "completion_window":"24h",
    "status":"validating",
    "output_file_id":null,
    "error_file_id":null,
    "finalizing_at":null,
    "failed_at":null,
    "expired_at":null,
    "cancelled_at":null,
    "request_counts":{
        "total":0,
        "completed":0,
        "failed":0
    },
    "metadata":null,
    "created_at":1736472600,
    "expires_at":1736559000,
    "cancelling_at":null,
    "completed_at":null,
    "in_progress_at":null
}
```

### 4. Check Batch Status
You can check the status of a batch any time your heart desires with the batch `id` (in this case, `batch_01jh6xa7reempvjyh6n3yst2zw` from the above Batch response object), which will also return a Batch object:

The status of a given batch job can return any of the following status codes:

| Status        | Description                                                                |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `validating`  | batch file is being validated before the batch processing begins           |
| `failed`      | batch file has failed the validation process                               |
| `in_progress` | batch file was successfully validated and the batch is currently being run |
| `finalizing`  | batch has completed and the results are being prepared                     |
| `completed`   | batch has been completed and the results are ready                         |
| `expired`     | batch was not able to be completed within the processing window          |
| `cancelling`  | batch is being cancelled (may take up to 10 minutes)                       |
| `cancelled`   | batch was cancelled                                                        |

When your batch job is complete, the Batch object will return an `output_file_id` and/or an `error_file_id` that you can then use to retrieve
your results (as shown below in Step 5). Here's an example:
```json
{
    "id":"batch_01jh6xa7reempvjyh6n3yst2zw",
    "object":"batch",
    "endpoint":"/v1/chat/completions",
    "errors":[
        {
            "code":"invalid_method",
            "message":"Invalid value: 'GET'. Supported values are: 'POST'","param":"method",
            "line":4
        }
    ],
    "input_file_id":"file_01jh6x76wtemjr74t1fh0faj5t",
    "completion_window":"24h",
    "status":"completed",
    "output_file_id":"file_01jh6xa97be52b7pg88czwrrwb",
    "error_file_id":"file_01jh6xa9cte52a5xjnmnt5y0je",
    "finalizing_at":null,
    "failed_at":null,
    "expired_at":null,
    "cancelled_at":null,
    "request_counts":
    {
        "total":3,
        "completed":2,
        "failed":1
    },
    "metadata":null,
    "created_at":1736472600,
    "expires_at":1736559000,
    "cancelling_at":null,
    "completed_at":1736472607,
    "in_progress_at":1736472601
}
```

### 5. Retrieve Batch Results 
Now for the fun. Once the batch is complete, you can retrieve the results using the `output_file_id` from your Batch object (in this case, `file_01jh6xa97be52b7pg88czwrrwb` from the above Batch response object) and write it to
a file on your machine (`batch_output.jsonl` in this case) to view them:

The output `.jsonl` file will have one response line per successful request line of your batch file. Each line includes the original `custom_id`
for mapping results, a unique batch request ID, and the response:

```json
{"id": "batch_req_123", "custom_id": "my-request-1", "response": {"status_code": 200, "request_id": "req_abc", "body": {"id": "completion_xyz", "model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 20, "completion_tokens": 5, "total_tokens": 25}}}, "error": null}
```

Any failed  or expired requests in the batch will have their error information written to an error file that can be accessed via the batch's `error_file_id`. 
**Note:** Results may not appears in the same order as your batch request submissions. Always use the `custom_id` field to match results with your
original request. 


## List Batches
The `/batches` endpoint provides two ways to access your batch information: browsing all batches with cursor-based pagination (using the `cursor` parameter), or fetching specific batches by their IDs.

### Iterate Over All Batches
You can view all your batch jobs by making a call to `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/batches`. Use the `cursor` parameter with the `next_cursor` value from the previous response to get the next page of results:

The paginated response includes a `paging` object with the `next_cursor` for the next page:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "batch_01jh6xa7reempvjyh6n3yst111",
      "object": "batch",
      "status": "completed",
      "created_at": 1736472600,
      // ... other batch fields
    }
    // ... more batches
  ],
  "paging": {
    "next_cursor": "cursor_eyJpZCI6ImJhdGNoXzAxamg2eGE3cmVlbXB2ankifQ"
  }
}
```

### Get Specific Batches
You can check the status of multiple batches at once by providing multiple batch IDs as query parameters to the same `/batches` endpoint. This is useful when you have submitted multiple batch jobs and want to monitor their progress efficiently:

The multi-batch status request returns a JSON object with a `data` array containing the complete batch information for each requested batch:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "batch_01jh6xa7reempvjyh6n3yst111",
      "object": "batch",
      "endpoint": "/v1/chat/completions",
      "errors": null,

      "object": "batch",

      },
      "metadata": null,
      "created_at": 1736472700,
      "expires_at": 1736559100,
      "cancelling_at": null,
      "completed_at": 1736472800,
      "in_progress_at": 1736472701
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** You can only request up to 200 batch IDs in a single request.


## Batch Size
The Files API supports JSONL files up to 50,000 lines and 200MB in size. Multiple batch jobs can be submitted at once.

**Note:** Consider splitting very large workloads into multiple smaller batches (e.g. 1000 requests per batch) for a better chance at completion 
rather than expiration for when we are under heavy load.

## Batch Expiration
Each batch has a processing window (24 hours to 7 days) during which we'll process as many requests as our capacity allows while maintaining service quality for all users.

We recommend setting a longer batch window for a better chance of completing your batch job rather than returning expired jobs when we are under 
heavy load.

Batch jobs that do not complete within their processing window will have a status of `expired`. 

In cases where your batch job expires:
- You are only charged for successfully completed requests
- You can access all completed results and see which request IDs were not processed
- You can resubmit any uncompleted requests in a new batch


## Data Expiration
Input, intermediate files, and results from processed batches will be stored securely for up to 30 days in Groq's systems. You may also immediately delete once a processed batch is retrieved.

## Rate limits
The Batch API rate limits are separate than existing per-model rate limits for synchronous requests. Using the Batch API will not consume tokens 
from your standard per-model limits, which means you can conveniently leverage batch processing to increase the number of tokens you process with
us.

See your limits [here.](https://groq.com/settings/limits)

#### 3. (Optional) [Create a new project](https://app.phoenix.arize.com/projects) or use the "default" project as your `project_name` below.

#### 4. Create your first traced Groq application:

In Arize Phoenix, **traces** capture the complete journey of an LLM request through your application, while **spans** represent individual operations within that trace. The instrumentation 
automatically captures important metrics and metadata.

```python
import os
from phoenix.otel import register
from openinference.instrumentation.groq import GroqInstrumentor
from groq import Groq

# Configure environment variables for Phoenix
os.environ["OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS"] = f"api_key={os.getenv('PHOENIX_API_KEY')}"
os.environ["PHOENIX_CLIENT_HEADERS"] = f"api_key={os.getenv('PHOENIX_API_KEY')}"
os.environ["PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT"] = "https://app.phoenix.arize.com"

# Configure Phoenix tracer
tracer_provider = register(
    project_name="default",
    endpoint="https://app.phoenix.arize.com/v1/traces",
)

# Initialize Groq instrumentation
GroqInstrumentor().instrument(tracer_provider=tracer_provider)

# Create Groq client
client = Groq(api_key=os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY"))

# Make an instrumented LLM call
chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Explain the importance of AI observability"
    }],
    model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
)

print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

Running the above code will create an automatically instrumented Groq application! The traces will be available in your Phoenix dashboard within the `default` project, showing 
detailed information about:
- **Application Latency:** Identify slow components and bottlenecks
- **Token Usage:** Track token consumption across different operations
- **Runtime Exceptions:** Capture and analyze errors and rate limits
- **LLM Parameters:** Monitor temperature, system prompts, and other settings
- **Response Analysis:** Examine LLM outputs and their characteristics

**Challenge**: Update an existing Groq-powered application you've built to add Arize Phoenix tracing!

## Responses API

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/responses-api

# Responses API

Groq's Responses API is fully compatible with OpenAI's Responses API, making it easy to integrate advanced conversational AI capabilities into your applications. The Responses API supports both text and image inputs while producing text outputs, stateful conversations, and function calling to connect with external systems.

## Configuring OpenAI Client for Responses API

To use the Responses API with OpenAI's client libraries, configure your client with your Groq API key and set the base URL to `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`.

You can find your API key [here](/keys).

## Multi-turn Conversations

The Responses API on Groq doesn't support stateful conversations yet, so you'll need to keep track of the conversation history yourself and provide it in every request.

## Image Inputs

The Responses API supports image inputs with all [vision-capable models](/docs/vision). Here's an example of how to pass an image to the model.

## Built-In Tools

In addition to a model's regular [tool use capabilities](/docs/tool-use), the Responses API supports various built-in tools to extend your model's capabilities.

### Model Support

While all models support the Responses API, these built-in tools are only supported for the following models:

| Model ID                        | Browser Search | Code Execution |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| [openai/gpt-oss-20b](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-20b) | ✅ | ✅ |
| [openai/gpt-oss-120b](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-120b) | ✅ | ✅ |

### Code Execution Example

Enable your models to write and execute Python code for calculations, data analysis, and problem-solving - see our [code execution documentation](/docs/code-execution) for more details.

### Browser Search Example

Give your models access to real-time web content and up-to-date information - see our [browser search documentation](/docs/browser-search) for more details.

## Structured Outputs

Use structured outputs to ensure the model's response follows a specific JSON schema. This is useful for extracting structured data from text, ensuring consistent response formats, or integrating with downstream systems that expect specific data structures.

For a complete list of models that support structured outputs, see our [structured outputs documentation](/docs/structured-outputs).

### Using a Schema Validation Library

When working with Structured Outputs, you can use popular schema validation libraries like [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for TypeScript and [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) for Python. These libraries provide type safety, runtime validation, and seamless integration with JSON Schema generation.

## Reasoning

Use reasoning to let the model produce an internal chain of thought before generating a response. This is useful for complex problem solving, multi-step agentic workflow planning, and scientific analysis.

For a complete list of models that support reasoning, see our [reasoning documentation](/docs/reasoning).

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Responses API also supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/docs/mcp), an open-source standard that enables AI applications to connect with external systems like databases, APIs, and tools. MCP provides a standardized way for AI models to access and interact with your data and workflows.

With MCP, you can build AI agents that access your codebase through GitHub, query databases with natural language, browse the web for real-time information, or connect to any API-based service like Slack, Notion, or Google Calendar.

### MCP Example

Here's an example using [Hugging Face's MCP server](https://huggingface.co/settings/mcp) to search for trending AI models.

## Unsupported Features

Although Groq's Responses API is mostly compatible with OpenAI's Responses API, there are a few features we don't support just yet:

- `previous_response_id`
- `store`
- `truncation`
- `include`
- `safety_identifier`
- `prompt_cache_key`

Want to see one of these features supported? Let us know on our [Community forum](https://community.groq.com)!

## Detailed Usage Metrics

To include detailed usage metrics for each request (such as exact inference time), set the following header:

```text
Groq-Beta: inference-metrics
```

In the response body, the `metadata` field will include the following keys:
- `completion_time`: The time in seconds it took to generate the output
- `prompt_time`: The time in seconds it took to process the input prompt
- `queue_time`: The time in seconds the requests was queued before being processed
- `total_time`: The total time in seconds it took to process the request

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "completion_time": "2.567331286",
    "prompt_time": "0.003652567",
    "queue_time": "0.018393202",
    "total_time": "2.570983853"
  }
}
```

To calculate output tokens per second, combine the information from the `usage` field with the `metadata` field:
```text
output_tokens_per_second = usage.output_tokens / metadata.completion_time
```

## Next Steps

Explore more advanced use cases in our built-in [browser search](/docs/browser-search) and [code execution](/docs/code-execution) documentation, or learn about connecting to external systems with [MCP](/docs/mcp).

## Images and Vision

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/vision

# Images and Vision

Groq API offers fast inference and low latency for multimodal models with vision capabilities for understanding and interpreting visual data from images. By analyzing the content of an image, multimodal models can generate 
human-readable text for providing insights about given visual data. 

## Supported Models

Groq API supports powerful multimodal models that can be easily integrated into your applications to provide fast and accurate image processing for tasks such as visual question answering, caption generation, 
and Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

## How to Use Vision

Use Groq API vision features via:

- **GroqCloud Console Playground**: Use [Llama 4 Scout](/playground?model=meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct) or [Llama 4 Maverick](/playground?model=meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct) as the model and
upload your image.
- **Groq API Request:** Call the [`chat.completions`](/docs/text-chat#generating-chat-completions-with-groq-sdk) API endpoint and set the model to `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` or `meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct`. 
See code examples below.

<br />
## How to Pass Images from URLs as Input
The following are code examples for passing your image to the model via a URL: 

## How to Pass Locally Saved Images as Input
To pass locally saved images, we'll need to first encode our image to a base64 format string before passing it as the `image_url` in our API request as follows:

<br />

## Tool Use with Images
The `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`, `meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct` models support tool use! The following cURL example defines a `get_current_weather` tool that the model can leverage to answer a user query that contains a question about the 
weather along with an image of a location that the model can infer location (i.e. New York City) from:

<br />

The following is the output from our example above that shows how our model inferred the state as New York from the given image and called our example function:
<br />
```python
[
  {
    "id": "call_q0wg",
    "function": {
      "arguments": "{\"location\": \"New York, NY\",\"unit\": \"fahrenheit\"}",
      "name": "get_current_weather"
    },
    "type": "function"
  }
]
```

<br />

## JSON Mode with Images
The `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` and `meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct` models support JSON mode! The following Python example queries the model with an image and text (i.e. "Please pull out relevant information as a JSON object.") with `response_format`
set for JSON mode:

<br />

## Multi-turn Conversations with Images
The `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` and `meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct` models support multi-turn conversations! The following Python example shows a multi-turn user conversation about an image:

<br />


## Venture Deeper into Vision

### Use Cases to Explore
Vision models can be used in a wide range of applications. Here are some ideas:

- **Accessibility Applications:** Develop an application that generates audio descriptions for images by using a vision model to generate text descriptions for images, which can then 
be converted to audio with one of our audio endpoints.
- **E-commerce Product Description Generation:** Create an application that generates product descriptions for e-commerce websites.
- **Multilingual Image Analysis:** Create applications that can describe images in multiple languages.
- **Multi-turn Visual Conversations:** Develop interactive applications that allow users to have extended conversations about images.

These are just a few ideas to get you started. The possibilities are endless, and we're excited to see what you create with vision models powered by Groq for low latency and fast inference!

<br />

## Assistant Message Prefilling

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/prefilling

# Assistant Message Prefilling

When using Groq API, you can have more control over your model output by prefilling `assistant` messages. This technique gives you the ability to direct any text-to-text model powered by Groq to:
- Skip unnecessary introductions or preambles
- Enforce specific output formats (e.g., JSON, XML)
- Maintain consistency in conversations

## How to Prefill Assistant Messages
To prefill, simply include your desired starting text in the `assistant` message and the model will generate a response starting with the `assistant` message. 
<br />
**Note:** For some models, adding a newline after the prefill `assistant` message leads to better results.  
<br />
**💡 Tip:** Use the stop sequence (`stop`) parameter in combination with prefilling for even more concise results. We recommend using this for generating code snippets. 


## Example Usage
**Example 1: Controlling output format for concise code snippets**
<br />
When trying the below code, first try a request without the prefill and then follow up by trying another request with the prefill included to see the difference!


<br />

**Example 2: Extracting structured data from unstructured input**

## OpenAI Compatibility

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/openai

# OpenAI Compatibility
We designed Groq API to be mostly compatible with OpenAI's client libraries, making it easy to 
configure your existing applications to run on Groq and try our inference speed.
<br />
We also have our own [Groq Python and Groq TypeScript libraries](/docs/libraries) that we encourage you to use.

## Configuring OpenAI to Use Groq API
To start using Groq with OpenAI's client libraries, pass your Groq API key to the `api_key` parameter
and change the `base_url` to `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`:


You can find your API key [here](/keys). 

## Currently Unsupported OpenAI Features

Note that although Groq API is mostly OpenAI compatible, there are a few features we don't support just yet: 

### Text Completions
The following fields are currently not supported and will result in a 400 error (yikes) if they are supplied:
- `logprobs`

- `logit_bias`

- `top_logprobs`

- `messages[].name`

- If `N` is supplied, it must be equal to 1.

### Temperature
If you set a `temperature` value of 0, it will be converted to `1e-8`. If you run into any issues, please try setting the value to a float32 `> 0` and `<= 2`.

### Audio Transcription and Translation
The following values are not supported:
- `vtt`
- `srt`

## Responses API

Groq also supports the [Responses API](/docs/responses-api), which is a more advanced interface for generating model responses that supports both text and image inputs while producing text outputs. You can build stateful conversations by using previous responses as context, and extend your model's capabilities through function calling to connect with external systems and data sources.

### Feedback
If you'd like to see support for such features as the above on Groq API, please reach out to us and let us know by submitting a "Feature Request" via "Chat with us" in the menu after clicking your organization in the top right. We really value your feedback and would love to hear from you! 

## Next Steps

Migrate your prompts to open-source models using our [model migration guide](/docs/prompting/model-migration), or learn more about prompting in our [prompting guide](/docs/prompting).

## Prompt Caching

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/prompt-caching

# Prompt Caching
Model prompts often contain repetitive content, such as system prompts and tool definitions.
Prompt caching automatically reuses computation from recent requests when they share a common prefix, delivering significant cost savings and improved response times while maintaining data privacy through volatile-only storage that expires automatically.

Prompt caching works automatically on all your API requests with no code changes required and no additional fees.

## How It Works

1. **Prefix Matching**: When you send a request, the system examines and identifies matching prefixes from recently processed requests stored temporarily in volatile memory. Prefixes can include system prompts, tool definitions, few-shot examples, and more.

2. **Cache Hit**: If a matching prefix is found, cached computation is reused, dramatically reducing latency and token costs by 50% for cached portions.

3. **Cache Miss**: If no match exists, your prompt is processed normally, with the prefix temporarily cached for potential future matches.

4. **Automatic Expiration**: All cached data automatically expires within a few hours, which helps ensure privacy while maintaining the benefits.

Prompt caching works automatically on all your API requests to supported models with no code changes required and no additional fees. Groq tries to maximize cache hits, but this is not guaranteed. Pricing discount will only apply on successful cache hits.

Cached tokens do not count towards your rate limits. However, cached tokens are subtracted from your limits after processing, so it's still possible to hit your limits if you are sending a large number of input tokens in parallel requests.

## Supported Models

Prompt caching is currently only supported for the following models:


| Model ID                        | Model                          |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct-0905                  | Kimi K2 |
| openai/gpt-oss-20b                  | GPT-OSS 20B |
| openai/gpt-oss-120b                  | GPT-OSS 120B |
| openai/gpt-oss-safeguard-20b                  | GPT-OSS-Safeguard 20B |


We're starting with a limited selection of models and will roll out prompt caching to more models soon.

## Pricing

Prompt caching is provided at no additional cost. There is a 50% discount for cached input tokens.

## Structuring Prompts for Optimal Caching

Cache hits are only possible for exact prefix matches within a prompt. To realize caching benefits, you need to think strategically about prompt organization:

### Optimal Prompt Structure
Place static content like instructions and examples at the beginning of your prompt, and put variable content, such as user-specific information, at the end. This maximizes the length of the reusable prefix across different requests.

If you put variable information (like timestamps or user IDs) at the beginning, even identical system instructions later in the prompt won't benefit from caching because the prefixes won't match.

<br />

**Place static content first:**
- System prompts and instructions
- Few-shot examples
- Tool definitions
- Schema definitions
- Common context or background information

<br />

**Place dynamic content last:**
- User-specific queries
- Variable data
- Timestamps
- Session-specific information
- Unique identifiers

### Example Structure

```text
[SYSTEM PROMPT - Static]
[TOOL DEFINITIONS - Static]  
[FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES - Static]
[COMMON INSTRUCTIONS - Static]
[USER QUERY - Dynamic]
[SESSION DATA - Dynamic]
```

This structure maximizes the likelihood that the static prefix portion will match across different requests, enabling cache hits while keeping user-specific content at the end.

## Prompt Caching Examples


### How Prompt Caching Works in Multi-Turn Conversations

In this example, we demonstrate how to use prompt caching in a multi-turn conversation.

During each turn, the system automatically caches the longest matching prefix from previous requests. The system message and conversation history that remain unchanged between requests will be cached, while only new user messages and assistant responses need fresh processing.

This approach is useful for maintaining context in ongoing conversations without repeatedly processing the same information.

**For the first request:**
- `prompt_tokens`: Number of tokens in the system message and first user message
- `cached_tokens`: 0 (no cache hit on first request)

<br />

**For subsequent requests within the cache lifetime:**
- `prompt_tokens`: Total number of tokens in the entire conversation (system message + conversation history + new user message)
- `cached_tokens`: Number of tokens in the system message and previous conversation history that were served from cache

<br />

When set up properly, you should see increasing cache efficiency as the conversation grows, with the system message and earlier conversation turns being served from cache while only new content requires processing.

### How Prompt Caching Works with Large Context

In this example, we demonstrate caching large static content like legal documents, research papers, or extensive context that remains constant across multiple queries.

The large legal document in the system message represents static content that benefits significantly from caching. Once cached, subsequent requests with different questions about the same document will reuse the cached computation for the document analysis, processing only the new user questions.

This approach is particularly effective for document analysis, research assistance, or any scenario where you need to ask multiple questions about the same large piece of content.

**For the first request:**
- `prompt_tokens`: Total number of tokens in the system message (including the large legal document) and user message
- `cached_tokens`: 0 (no cache hit on first request)

<br />

**For subsequent requests within the cache lifetime:**
- `prompt_tokens`: Total number of tokens in the system message (including the large legal document) and user message
- `cached_tokens`: Number of tokens in the entire cached system message (including the large legal document)

<br />

The caching efficiency is particularly high in this scenario since the large document (which may be thousands of tokens) is reused across multiple requests, while only small user queries (typically dozens of tokens) need fresh processing.

### How Prompt Caching Works with Tool Definitions

In this example, we demonstrate caching tool definitions.

All tool definitions, including their schemas, descriptions, and parameters, are cached as a single prefix when they remain consistent across requests. This is particularly valuable when you have a comprehensive set of tools that you want to reuse across multiple requests without re-processing them each time.

The system message and all tool definitions form the static prefix that gets cached, while user queries remain dynamic and are processed fresh for each request.

This approach is useful when you have a consistent set of tools that you want to reuse across multiple requests without re-processing them each time.

**For the first request:**
- `prompt_tokens`: Total number of tokens in the system message, tool definitions, and user message
- `cached_tokens`: 0 (no cache hit on first request)

<br />

**For subsequent requests within the cache lifetime:**
- `prompt_tokens`: Total number of tokens in the system message, tool definitions, and user message
- `cached_tokens`: Number of tokens in all cached tool definitions and system prompt

<br />

Tool definitions can be quite lengthy due to detailed parameter schemas and descriptions, making caching particularly beneficial for reducing both latency and costs when the same tool set is used repeatedly.

## Requirements and Limitations

### Caching Requirements
- **Exact Prefix Matching**: Cache hits require exact matches of the beginning of your prompt
- **Minimum Prompt Length**: The minimum cacheable prompt length varies by model, ranging from 128 to 1024 tokens depending on the specific model used

To check how much of your prompt was cached, see the response [usage fields](#response-usage-structure).

### What Can Be Cached

- **Complete message arrays** including system, user, and assistant messages
- **Tool definitions** and function schemas
- **System instructions** and prompt templates
- **One-shot** and **few-shot examples**
- **Structured output schemas**
- **Large static content** like legal documents, research papers, or extensive context that remains constant across multiple queries
- **Image inputs**, including image URLs and base64-encoded images

### Limitations

- **Exact Matching**: Even minor changes in cached portions prevent cache hits and force a new cache to be created
- **No Manual Control**: Cache clearing and management is automatic only

## Tracking Cache Usage

You can monitor how many tokens are being served from cache by examining the `usage` field in your API response. The response includes detailed token usage information, including how many tokens were cached.

### Response Usage Structure

```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-...",
  "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct",
  "usage": {
      "queue_time": 0.026959759,
      "prompt_tokens": 4641,
      "prompt_time": 0.009995497,
      "completion_tokens": 1817,
      "completion_time": 5.57691751,
      "total_tokens": 6458,
      "total_time": 5.586913007,
      "prompt_tokens_details": {
          "cached_tokens": 4608
      }
  },
  ... other fields
}
```

### Understanding the Fields

- **`prompt_tokens`**: Total number of tokens in your input prompt
- **`cached_tokens`**: Number of input tokens that were served from cache (within `prompt_tokens_details`)
- **`completion_tokens`**: Number of tokens in the model's response
- **`total_tokens`**: Sum of prompt and completion tokens

<br />

In the example above, out of 4641 prompt tokens, 4608 tokens (99.3%) were served from cache, resulting in significant cost savings and improved response time.

### Calculating Cache Hit Rate

To calculate your cache hit rate:

```
Cache Hit Rate = cached_tokens / prompt_tokens × 100%
```

For the example above: `4608 / 4641 × 100% = 99.3%`

A higher cache hit rate indicates better prompt structure optimization leading to lower latency and more cost savings.

## Troubleshooting
- Verify that sections that you want to cache are identical between requests
- Check that calls are made within the cache lifetime (a few hours). Calls that are too far apart will not benefit from caching.
- Ensure that `tool_choice`, tool usage, and image usage remain consistent between calls
- Validate that you are caching at least the [minimum number of tokens](#caching-requirements) through the [usage fields](#response-usage-structure).

<br />

Changes to cached sections, including `tool_choice` and image usage, will invalidate the cache and require a new cache to be created. Subsequent calls will use the new cache.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is data privacy maintained with caching?

All cached data exists only in volatile memory and automatically expires within a few hours. No prompt or response content is ever stored in persistent storage or shared between organizations.

### Does caching affect the quality or consistency of responses?

No. Prompt caching only affects the processing of the input prompt, not the generation of responses. The actual model inference and response generation occur normally, maintaining identical output quality whether caching is used or not.

### Can I disable prompt caching?

Prompt caching is automatically enabled and cannot be manually disabled. This helps customers benefit from reduced costs and latency. Prompts are not stored in persistent storage.

### How do I know if my requests are benefiting from caching?

You can track cache usage by examining the `usage` field in your API responses. Cache hits are not guaranteed, but Groq tries to maximize them. See the [Tracking Cache Usage](#tracking-cache-usage) section above for detailed information on how to monitor cached tokens and calculate your cache hit rate.

### Are there any additional costs for using prompt caching?

No. Prompt caching is provided at no additional cost and can help to reduce your costs by 50% for cached tokens while improving response times.

### Does caching affect rate limits?

Cached tokens do not count toward your rate limits.

### Can I manually clear or refresh caches?

No manual cache management is available. All cache expiration and cleanup happens automatically.

### Does the prompt caching discount work with batch requests?

Batch requests can still benefit from prompt caching, but the prompt caching discount does not stack with the batch discount. [Batch requests](/docs/batch) already receive a 50% discount on all tokens, and while caching functionality remains active, no additional discount is applied to cached tokens in batch requests.

## Built-in Tools

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/compound/built-in-tools

# Built-in Tools

Compound systems come equipped with a comprehensive set of built-in tools that can be intelligently called to answer user queries. These tools not only expand the capabilities of language models by providing access to real-time information, computational power, and interactive environments, but also eliminate the need to build and maintain the underlying infrastructure for these tools yourself.

**Built-in tools with Compound systems are not HIPAA Covered Cloud Services under Groq's Business Associate Addendum at this time. These tools are also not available currently for use with regional / sovereign endpoints.**

## Default Tools
The tools enabled by default vary depending on your Compound system version:
| Version | Web Search | Code Execution | Visit Website |
|---------|------------|----------------|---------------|
| Newer than `2025-07-23` (Latest) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `2025-07-23` (Default) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

All tools are automatically enabled by default. Compound systems intelligently decide when to use each tool based on the user's query.

<br />

For more information on how to set your Compound system version, see the [Compound System Versioning](/docs/compound#system-versioning) page.

## Available Tools

These are all the available built-in tools on Groq's Compound systems.

| Tool | Description | Identifier | Supported Compound Version |
|------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| [Web Search](/docs/web-search) | Access real-time web content and up-to-date information with automatic citations | `web_search` | All versions |
| [Visit Website](/docs/visit-website) | Fetch and analyze content from specific web pages | `visit_website` | `latest` |
| [Browser Automation](/docs/browser-automation) | Interact with web pages through automated browser actions | `browser_automation` | `latest` |
| [Code Execution](/docs/code-execution) | Execute Python code automatically in secure sandboxed environments | `code_interpreter` | All versions |
| [Wolfram Alpha](/docs/wolfram-alpha) | Access computational knowledge and mathematical calculations | `wolfram_alpha` | `latest` |

<br />

Jump to the [Configuring Tools](#configuring-tools) section to learn how to enable specific tools via their identifiers.
Some tools are only available on certain Compound system versions - [learn more about how to set your Compound version here](/docs/compound#system-versioning).

## Configuring Tools

You can customize which tools are available to Compound systems using the `compound_custom.tools.enabled_tools` parameter.
This allows you to restrict or specify exactly which tools should be available for a particular request.

<br />

For a list of available tool identifiers, see the [Available Tools](#available-tools) section.

### Example: Enable Specific Tools


### Example: Code Execution Only


## Pricing

# Compound

While LLMs excel at generating text, Groq's Compound systems take the next step. 
Compound is an advanced AI system that is designed to solve problems by taking action and intelligently uses external tools, such as web search and code execution, alongside the powerful [GPT-OSS 120B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-120b), [Llama 4 Scout](/docs/model/meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct), and [Llama 3.3 70B](/docs/model/llama-3.3-70b-versatile) models.
This allows it access to real-time information and interaction with external environments, providing more accurate, up-to-date, and capable responses than an LLM alone.

## Available Compound Systems

There are two compound systems available:
 - [`groq/compound`](/docs/compound/systems/compound): supports multiple tool calls per request. This system is great for use cases that require multiple web searches or code executions per request.
 - [`groq/compound-mini`](/docs/compound/systems/compound-mini): supports a single tool call per request. This system is great for use cases that require a single web search or code execution per request. `groq/compound-mini` has an average of 3x lower latency than `groq/compound`.

Both systems support the following tools:

- [Web Search](/docs/web-search)
- [Visit Website](/docs/visit-website)
- [Code Execution](/docs/code-execution)
- [Browser Automation](/docs/browser-automation)
- [Wolfram Alpha](/docs/wolfram-alpha)

<br/>

Custom [user-provided tools](/docs/tool-use) are not supported at this time.

## Quickstart

To use compound systems, change the `model` parameter to either `groq/compound` or `groq/compound-mini`:


And that's it!

<br/>

When the API is called, it will intelligently decide when to use search or code execution to best answer the user's query.
These tool calls are performed on the server side, so no additional setup is required on your part to use built-in tools.

<br/>

In the above example, the API will use its build in web search tool to find the current weather in Tokyo.
If you didn't use compound systems, you might have needed to add your own custom tools to make API requests to a weather service, then perform multiple API calls to Groq to get a final result.
Instead, with compound systems, you can get a final result with a single API call.

## Executed Tools

To view the tools (search or code execution) used automatically by the compound system, check the `executed_tools` field in the response:


## Model Usage Details

The `usage_breakdown` field in responses provides detailed information about all the underlying models used during the compound system's execution. 

```json
"usage_breakdown": {
  "models": [
    {
      "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
      "usage": {
        "queue_time": 0.017298032,
        "prompt_tokens": 226,
        "prompt_time": 0.023959775,

        "total_time": 1.809549424
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## System Versioning
Compound systems support versioning through the `Groq-Model-Version` header. In most cases, you won't need to change anything since you'll automatically be on the latest stable version. To view the latest changes to the compound systems, see the [Compound Changelog](/docs/changelog/compound).

### Available Systems and Versions
| System | Default Version<br/>(no header) | Latest Version<br/>(`Groq-Model-Version: latest`) | Previous Versions |
|--------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| [`groq/compound`](/docs/compound/systems/compound) | `2025-08-16` (stable) | `2025-08-16` (latest) | `2025-07-23` |
| [`groq/compound-mini`](/docs/compound/systems/compound-mini) | `2025-08-16` (stable) | `2025-08-16` (latest) | `2025-07-23` |

### Version Details

- **Default (no header)**: Uses version `2025-08-16`, the most recent stable version that has been fully tested and deployed
- **Latest** (`Groq-Model-Version: latest`): Uses version `2025-08-16`, the prerelease version with the newest features before they're rolled out to everyone

- **[Use Cases](/docs/compound/use-cases)** - Explore practical applications and detailed examples

---

## Use Cases

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/compound/use-cases

# Use Cases

Groq's compound systems excel at a wide range of use cases, particularly when real-time information is required.

## Real-time Fact Checker and News Agent

Your application needs to answer questions or provide information that requires up-to-the-minute knowledge, such as:
- Latest news
- Current stock prices
- Recent events
- Weather updates

Building and maintaining your own web scraping or search API integration is complex and time-consuming.

### Solution with Compound
Simply send the user's query to `groq/compound`. If the query requires current information beyond its training data, it will automatically trigger its built-in web search tool to fetch relevant, live data before formulating the answer.

### Why It's Great
- Get access to real-time information instantly without writing any extra code for search integration
- Leverage Groq's speed for a real-time, responsive experience

### Code Example

### Why It's Great
- Provides a unified interface for getting code help
- Potentially draws on live web data for new errors
- Executes code directly for validation
- Speeds up the debugging process

**Note**: `groq/compound-mini` uses one tool per turn, so it might search OR execute, not both simultaneously in one response.

## Chart Generation

Need to quickly create data visualizations from natural language descriptions? Compound's code execution capabilities can help generate charts without writing visualization code directly.

### Solution with Compound
Describe the chart you want in natural language, and Compound will generate and execute the appropriate Python visualization code. The model automatically parses your request, generates the visualization code using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn, and returns the chart.

### Why It's Great
- Generate charts from simple natural language descriptions
- Supports common chart types (scatter, line, bar, etc.)
- Handles all visualization code generation and execution
- Customize data points, labels, colors, and layouts as needed

### Usage and Results

## Natural Language Calculator and Code Extractor

You want users to perform calculations, run simple data manipulations, or execute small code snippets using natural language commands within your application, without building a dedicated parser or execution environment.

### Solution with Compound

Frame the user's request as a task involving computation or code. `groq/compound-mini` can recognize these requests and use its secure code execution tool to compute the result.

### Why It's Great
 - Effortlessly add computational capabilities
 - Users can ask things like:
   - "What's 15% of $540?"
   - "Calculate the standard deviation of [10, 12, 11, 15, 13]"
   - "Run this python code: print('Hello from Compound!')"

## Code Debugging Assistant

Developers often need quick help understanding error messages or testing small code fixes. Searching documentation or running snippets requires switching contexts.

### Solution with Compound
Users can paste an error message and ask for explanations or potential causes. Compound Mini might use web search to find recent discussions or documentation about that specific error. Alternatively, users can provide a code snippet and ask "What's wrong with this code?" or "Will this Python code run: ...?". It can use code execution to test simple, self-contained snippets.

### Why It's Great
- Provides a unified interface for getting code help
- Potentially draws on live web data for new errors
- Executes code directly for validation
- Speeds up the debugging process

**Note**: `groq/compound-mini` uses one tool per turn, so it might search OR execute, not both simultaneously in one response.

## E2B + Groq: Open-Source Code Interpreter

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/e2b

## E2B + Groq: Open-Source Code Interpreter

[E2B](https://e2b.dev/) Code Interpreter is an open-source SDK that provides secure, sandboxed environments for executing code generated by LLMs via Groq API. Built specifically for AI data analysts, 
coding applications, and reasoning-heavy agents, E2B enables you to both generate and execute code in a secure sandbox environment in real-time.

### Python Quick Start (3 minutes to hello world)

#### 1. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install groq e2b-code-interpreter python-dotenv
```

#### 2. Configure your Groq and [E2B](https://e2b.dev/docs) API keys:
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
export E2B_API_KEY="your-e2b-api-key"
```

#### 3. Create your first simple and fast Code Interpreter application that generates and executes code to analyze data:

Running the below code will create a secure sandbox environment, generate Python code using `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` powered by Groq, execute the code, and display the results. When you go to your 
[E2B Dashboard](https://e2b.dev/dashboard), you'll see your sandbox's data. 

```python
from e2b_code_interpreter import Sandbox
from groq import Groq
import os

e2b_api_key = os.environ.get('E2B_API_KEY')
groq_api_key = os.environ.get('GROQ_API_KEY')

# Initialize Groq client
client = Groq(api_key=groq_api_key)

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a Python data scientist. Generate simple code that:
1. Uses numpy to generate 5 random numbers
2. Prints only the mean and standard deviation in a clean format
Example output format:
Mean: 5.2
Std Dev: 1.8"""

def main():
    # Create sandbox instance (by default, sandbox instances stay alive for 5 mins)
    sbx = Sandbox()
    
    # Get code from Groq
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="llama-3.1-70b-versatile",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT},
            {"role": "user", "content": "Generate random numbers and show their mean and standard deviation"}
        ]
    )
    
    # Extract and run the code
    code = response.choices[0].message.content
    if "```python" in code:
        code = code.split("```python")[1].split("```")[0]
    
    print("\nGenerated Python code:")
    print(code)
    
    print("\nExecuting code in sandbox...")
    execution = sbx.run_code(code)
    print(execution.logs.stdout[0])
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Challenge**: Try modifying the example to analyze your own dataset or solve a different data science problem!

## 🎨 Gradio + Groq: Easily Build Web Interfaces

[Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) is a powerful library for creating web interfaces for your applications that enables you to quickly build 
interactive demos for your fast Groq apps with features such as:

- **Interface Builder:** Create polished UIs with just a few lines of code, supporting text, images, audio, and more
- **Interactive Demos:** Build demos that showcase your LLM applications with multiple input/output components
- **Shareable Apps:** Deploy and share your Groq-powered applications with a single click

### Quick Start (2 minutes to hello world)

#### 1. Install the packages:
```bash
pip install groq-gradio
```

#### 2. Set up your API key:
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
```

#### 3. Create your first Gradio chat interface:
The following code creates a simple chat interface with `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` that includes a clean UI.
```python
import gradio as gr
import groq_gradio
import os

# Initialize Groq client
client = Groq(
    api_key=os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY")
)

gr.load(
    name='llama-3.3-70b-versatile', # The specific model powered by Groq to use
    src=groq_gradio.registry, # Tells Gradio to use our custom interface registry as the source
    title='Groq-Gradio Integration', # The title shown at the top of our UI
    description="Chat with the Llama 3.3 70B model powered by Groq.", # Subtitle
    examples=["Explain quantum gravity to a 5-year old.", "How many R are there in the word Strawberry?"] # Pre-written prompts users can click to try
).launch() # Creates and starts the web server!
```

**Challenge**: Enhance the above example to create a multi-modal chatbot that leverages text, audio, and vision models powered by Groq and
displayed on a customized UI built with Gradio blocks!

## Introduction to Tool Use

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/tool-use

# Introduction to Tool Use
Tool use is a powerful feature that allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external resources, such as APIs, databases, and the web, to gather dynamic data they wouldn't otherwise have access to in their pre-trained (or static) state and perform actions beyond simple text generation. 
<br />
Tool use bridges the gap between the data that the LLMs were trained on with dynamic data and real-world actions, which opens up a wide array of realtime use cases for us to build powerful applications with, especially with Groq's insanely fast inference speed. 🚀

## Supported Models

## Agentic Tooling

In addition to the models that support custom tools above, Groq also offers agentic tool systems.
These are AI systems with tools like web search and code execution built directly into the system.
You don't need to specify any tools yourself - the system will automatically use its built-in tools as needed.
<br/


## How Tool Use Works
Groq API tool use structure is compatible with OpenAI's tool use structure, which allows for easy integration. See the following cURL example of a tool use request:
<br />
```bash
curl https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $GROQ_API_KEY" \
-d '{
  "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What'\''s the weather like in Boston today?"
    }
  ],
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_current_weather",
        "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "location": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
            },
            "unit": {
              "type": "string",
              "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]
            }
          },
          "required": ["location"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "tool_choice": "auto"
}'
```
<br />
To integrate tools with Groq API, follow these steps:
1. Provide tools (or predefined functions) to the LLM for performing actions and accessing external data in 
real-time in addition to your user prompt within your Groq API request
2. Define how the tools should be used to teach the LLM how to use them effectively (e.g. by defining input and 
output formats)
3. Let the LLM autonomously decide whether or not the provided tools are needed for a user query by evaluating the user 
query, determining whether the tools can enhance its response, and utilizing the tools accordingly
4. Extract tool input, execute the tool code, and return results
5. Let the LLM use the tool result to formulate a response to the original prompt

This process allows the LLM to perform tasks such as real-time data retrieval, complex calculations, and external API 
interaction, all while maintaining a natural conversation with our end user.

## Tool Use with Groq

Groq API endpoints support tool use to almost instantly deliver structured JSON output that can be used to directly invoke functions from 
desired external resources.

### Tools Specifications
Tool use is part of the [Groq API chat completion request payload](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#chat-create).
Groq API tool calls are structured to be OpenAI-compatible.

### Tool Calls Structure
The following is an example tool calls structure:
```json
{
  "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a weather assistant. Use the get_weather function to retrieve weather information for a given location."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What's the weather like in New York today?"
    }
  ],
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get the current weather for a location",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "location": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
            },
            "unit": {
              "type": "string",
              "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
              "description": "The unit of temperature to use. Defaults to fahrenheit."
            }
          },
          "required": ["location"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "tool_choice": "auto",
  "max_completion_tokens": 4096
}'
```

### Tool Calls Response
The following is an example tool calls response based on the above:
```json
"model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
"choices": [{
    "index": 0,
    "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "tool_calls": [{
            "id": "call_d5wg",
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "get_weather",
                "arguments": "{\"location\": \"New York, NY\"}"
            }
        }]
    },
    "logprobs": null,
    "finish_reason": "tool_calls"
}],
```
<br />
When a model decides to use a tool, it returns a response with a `tool_calls` object containing:
- `id`: a unique identifier for the tool call
- `type`: the type of tool calls, i.e. function
- `name`: the name of the tool being used
- `parameters`: an object containing the input being passed to the tool


## Setting Up Tools
To get started, let's go through an example of tool use with Groq API that you can use as a base to build more tools on
your own.
<br />
#### Step 1: Create Tool
Let's install Groq SDK, set up our Groq client, and create a function called `calculate` to evaluate a mathematical 
expression that we will represent as a tool.
<br />
Note: In this example, we're defining a function as our tool, but your tool can be any function or an external
resource (e.g. dabatase, web search engine, external API).

#### Step 2: Pass Tool Definition and Messages to Model 
Next, we'll define our `calculate` tool within an array of available `tools` and call our Groq API chat completion. You 
can read more about tool schema and supported required and optional fields above in [Tool Specifications](#tool-call-and-tool-response-structure).
<br />
By defining our tool, we'll inform our model about what our tool does and have the model decide whether or not to use the
tool. We should be as descriptive and specific as possible for our model to be able to make the correct tool use decisions.
<br />
In addition to our `tools` array, we will provide our `messages` array (e.g. containing system prompt, assistant prompt, and/or
user prompt). 

#### Step 3: Receive and Handle Tool Results
After executing our chat completion, we'll extract our model's response and check for tool calls.
<br />
If the model decides that no tools should be used and does not generate a tool or function call, then the response will 
be a normal chat completion (i.e. `response_message = response.choices[0].message`) with a direct model reply to the user query. 
<br />
If the model decides that tools should be used and generates a tool or function call, we will:
1. Define available tool or function
2. Add the model's response to the conversation by appending our message
3. Process the tool call and add the tool response to our message
4. Make a second Groq API call with the updated conversation
5. Return the final response


## Parallel Tool Use
We learned about tool use and built single-turn tool use examples above. Now let's take tool use a step further and imagine
a workflow where multiple tools can be called simultaneously, enabling more efficient and effective responses.
<br />
This concept is known as **parallel tool use** and is key for building agentic workflows that can deal with complex queries, 
which is a great example of where inference speed becomes increasingly important (and thankfully we can access fast inference
speed with Groq API). 
<br />
Here's an example of parallel tool use with a tool for getting the temperature and the tool for getting the weather condition
to show parallel tool use with Groq API in action:


## Error Handling
Groq API tool use is designed to verify whether a model generates a valid tool calls object. When a model fails to generate a valid tool calls object, 
Groq API will return a 400 error with an explanation in the "failed_generation" field of the JSON body that is returned.

### Next Steps
For more information and examples of working with multiple tools in parallel using Groq API and Instructor, see our Groq API Cookbook
tutorial [here](https://github.com/groq/groq-api-cookbook/blob/main/tutorials/parallel-tool-use/parallel-tool-use.ipynb).

<br />

## Tool Use with Structured Outputs (Python)
Groq API offers best-effort matching for parameters, which means the model could occasionally miss parameters or 
misinterpret types for more complex tool calls. We recommend the [Instuctor](https://python.useinstructor.com/hub/groq/)
library to simplify the process of working with structured data and to ensure that the model's output adheres to a predefined
schema.
<br />
Here's an example of how to implement tool use using the Instructor library with Groq API:
<br />

### Benefits of Using Structured Outputs
- Type Safety: Pydantic models ensure that output adheres to the expected structure, reducing the risk of errors.
- Automatic Validation: Instructor automatically validates the model's output against the defined schema.

tutorial [here](https://github.com/groq/groq-api-cookbook/blob/main/tutorials/structured-output-instructor/structured_output_instructor.ipynb).


## Streaming Tool Use
The Groq API also offers streaming tool use, where you can stream tool use results to the client as they are generated.

```python
from groq import Groq
import json

client = Groq()

async def main():
    stream = await client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a helpful assistant.",
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                # We first ask it to write a Poem, to show the case where there's text output before function calls, since that is also supported
                "content": "What is the weather in San Francisco and in Tokyo? First write a short poem.",
            },
        ],
        tools=[
            {
                "type": "function",
                "function": {
                    "name": "get_current_weather",
                    "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
                    "parameters": {
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {
                            "location": {
                                "type": "string",
                                "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
                            },
                            "unit": {
                                "type": "string",
                                "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]
                            }
                        },
                        "required": ["location"]
                    }
                }
            }
        ],
        model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
        temperature=0.5,
        stream=True
    )

    async for chunk in stream:
        print(json.dumps(chunk.model_dump()) + "\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```


## Best Practices

- Provide detailed tool descriptions for optimal performance.
- We recommend tool use with the Instructor library for structured outputs.
- Implement a routing system when using fine-tuned models in your workflow.
- Handle tool execution errors by returning error messages with `"is_error": true`.

## Google Cloud Private Service Connect

Private Service Connect (PSC) enables you to access Groq's API services through private network connections, eliminating exposure to the public internet. This guide explains how to set up Private Service Connect for secure access to Groq services.

### Overview

Groq exposes its API endpoints in Google Cloud Platform as PSC _published services_. By configuring PSC endpoints, you can:
- Access Groq services through private IP addresses within your VPC
- Eliminate public internet exposure
- Maintain strict network security controls
- Minimize latency
- Reduce data transfer costs

```

### Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud project with [Private Service Connect enabled](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-service-connect-consumer)
- VPC network where you want to create the PSC endpoint
- Appropriate IAM permissions to create PSC endpoints and DNS zones
- Enterprise plan with Groq
- Provided Groq with your GCP Project ID
- Groq has accepted your GCP Project ID to our Private Service Connect

### Setup

The steps below use us as an example. Make sure you configure your system
according to the region(s) you want to use.

#### 1. Connect an endpoint

1. Navigate to **Network services** > **Private Service Connect** in your Google Cloud Console
2. Go to the **Endpoints** section and click **Connect endpoint**
   * Under **Target**, select _Published service_
   * For **Target service**, enter a [published service](#published-services) target name.
   * For **Endpoint name**, enter a descriptive name (e.g., `groq-api-psc`)
   * Select your desired **Network** and **Subnetwork**
   * For **IP address**, create and select an internal IP from your subnet
   * Enable **Global access** if you need to connect from multiple regions
3. Click **Add endpoint** and verify the status shows as _Accepted_

#### 2. Configure Private DNS

1. Go to **Network services** > **Cloud DNS** in your Google Cloud Console
2. Create the first zone for groq.com:
   * Click **Create zone**
   * Set **Zone type** to _Private_
   * Enter a descriptive **Zone name** (e.g., `groq-api-private`)
   * For **DNS name**, enter `groq.com.`
   * Create an `A` record:
     * **DNS name**: `api`
     * **Resource record type**: `A`
     * Enter your PSC endpoint IP address
   * Link the private zone to your VPC network

3. Create the second zone for groqcloud.com:
   * Click **Create zone**
   * Set **Zone type** to _Private_
   * Enter a descriptive **Zone name** (e.g., `groqcloud-api-private`)
   * For **DNS name**, enter `groqcloud.com.`
   * Create an `A` record:
     * **DNS name**: `api.us`
     * **Resource record type**: `A`
     * Enter your PSC endpoint IP address
   * Link the private zone to your VPC network

#### 3. Validate the Connection

To verify your setup:

1. SSH into a VM in your VPC network
2. Test DNS resolution for both endpoints:
   ```bash
   dig +short api.groq.com
   dig +short api.us.groqcloud.com
   ```
   Both should return your PSC endpoint IP address

3. Test API connectivity (using either endpoint):
   ```bash
   curl -i https://api.groq.com
   # or
   curl -i https://api.us.groqcloud.com
   ```
   Should return a successful response through your private connection

### Published Services

| Service | PSC Target Name | Private DNS Names |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| API     | projects/groq-pe/regions/me-central2/serviceAttachments/groqcloud | api.groq.com, api.me-central-1.groqcloud.com |
| API     | projects/groq-pe/regions/us-central1/serviceAttachments/groqcloud | api.groq.com, api.us.groqcloud.com |

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter connectivity issues:

1. Verify DNS resolution is working correctly for both domains
2. Check that your security groups and firewall rules allow traffic to the PSC endpoint
3. Ensure your service account has the necessary permissions
4. Verify the PSC endpoint status is _Accepted_
5. Confirm the model you are requesting is operating in the target region

### Alerting

To monitor and alert on an unexpected change in connectivity status for the PSC endpoint, use a [Google Cloud log-based alerting policy](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/alerting/log-based-alerts).

Below is an example of an alert policy that will alert the given notification channel in the case of a connection being _Closed_. This will require manual intervention to reconnect the endpoint.

```hcl
resource "google_monitoring_alert_policy" "groq_psc" {
  display_name = "Groq - Private Service Connect"
  combiner     = "OR"

  conditions {
    display_name = "Connection Closed"
    condition_matched_log {
      filter = <<-EOF
        resource.type="gce_forwarding_rule"
        protoPayload.methodName="LogPscConnectionStatusUpdate"
        protoPayload.metadata.pscConnectionStatus="CLOSED"
      EOF
    }
  }

  notification_channels = [google_monitoring_notification_channel.my_alert_channel.id]
  severity              = "CRITICAL"

  alert_strategy {
    notification_prompts = ["OPENED"]

    notification_rate_limit {
      period = "600s"
    }
  }

  documentation {
    mime_type = "text/markdown"
    subject   = "Groq forwarding rule was unexpectedly closed"
    content   = <<-EOF
    Forwarding rule $${resource.label.forwarding_rule_id} was unexpectedly closed. Please contact Groq Support (support@groq.com) for remediation steps.

    - **Project**: $${project}
    - **Alert Policy**: $${policy.display_name}
    - **Condition**: $${condition.display_name}
    EOF

    links {
      display_name = "Dashboard"
      url          = "https://console.cloud.google.com/net-services/psc/list/consumers?project=${var.project_id}"
    }
  }
}
```

## Reasoning

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/reasoning

# Reasoning 
Reasoning models excel at complex problem-solving tasks that require step-by-step analysis, logical deduction, and structured thinking and solution validation. With Groq inference speed, these types of models 
can deliver instant reasoning capabilities critical for real-time applications. 

## Why Speed Matters for Reasoning
Reasoning models are capable of complex decision making with explicit reasoning chains that are part of the token output and used for decision-making, which make low-latency and fast inference essential. 
Complex problems often require multiple chains of reasoning tokens where each step build on previous results. Low latency compounds benefits across reasoning chains and shaves off minutes of reasoning to a response in seconds. 

## Supported Models

| Model ID                        | Model                          |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `openai/gpt-oss-20b`                  | [OpenAI GPT-OSS 20B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-20b)
| `openai/gpt-oss-120b`                  | [OpenAI GPT-OSS 120B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-120b)
| `openai/gpt-oss-safeguard-20b`                  | [OpenAI GPT-OSS-Safeguard 20B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-safeguard-20b)
| `qwen/qwen3-32b`                  | [Qwen 3 32B](/docs/model/qwen3-32b)

## Reasoning Format
Groq API supports explicit reasoning formats through the `reasoning_format` parameter, giving you fine-grained control over how the model's 
reasoning process is presented. This is particularly valuable for valid JSON outputs, debugging, and understanding the model's decision-making process.

 

**Note:** The format defaults to `raw` or `parsed` when JSON mode or tool use are enabled as those modes do not support `raw`. If reasoning is 
explicitly set to `raw` with JSON mode or tool use enabled, we will return a 400 error.

### Options for Reasoning Format
| `reasoning_format` Options | Description                                                |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------| 
| `parsed` | Separates reasoning into a dedicated `message.reasoning` field while keeping the response concise. |
| `raw`    | Includes reasoning within `<think>` tags in the main text content. |
| `hidden`  | Returns only the final answer. | 


### Including Reasoning in the Response

You can also control whether reasoning is included in the response by setting the `include_reasoning` parameter.

| `include_reasoning` Options | Description                                                |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------| 
| `true` | Includes the reasoning in a dedicated `message.reasoning` field. This is the default behavior. |
| `false`  | Excludes reasoning from the response. | 

 

**Note:** The `include_reasoning` parameter cannot be used together with `reasoning_format`. These parameters are mutually exclusive.



## Reasoning Effort

### Options for Reasoning Effort (Qwen 3 32B)

The `reasoning_effort` parameter controls the level of effort the model will put into reasoning. This is only supported by [Qwen 3 32B](/docs/model/qwen3-32b).

| `reasoning_effort` Options | Description                                                |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------| 
| `none` | Disable reasoning. The model will not use any reasoning tokens. |
| `default` | Enable reasoning. |

### Options for Reasoning Effort (GPT-OSS)

The `reasoning_effort` parameter controls the level of effort the model will put into reasoning. This is only supported by [GPT-OSS 20B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-20b) and [GPT-OSS 120B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-120b).

| `reasoning_effort` Options | Description                                                |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------| 
| `low` | Low effort reasoning. The model will use a small number of reasoning tokens. |
| `medium` | Medium effort reasoning. The model will use a moderate number of reasoning tokens. |
| `high` | High effort reasoning. The model will use a large number of reasoning tokens. |


## Quick Start

Get started with reasoning models using this basic example that demonstrates how to make a simple API call for complex problem-solving tasks.

## Quick Start with Tool Use

This example shows how to combine reasoning models with function calling to create intelligent agents that can perform actions while explaining their thought process.

```bash
curl https://api.groq.com//openai/v1/chat/completions -s \
  -H "authorization: bearer $GROQ_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-oss-20b",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is the weather like in Paris today?"
        }
    ],
    "tools": [
        {
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "get_weather",
                "description": "Get current temperature for a given location.",
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "location": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "City and country e.g. Bogotá, Colombia"
                        }
                    },
                    "required": [
                        "location"
                    ],
                    "additionalProperties": false
                },
                "strict": true
            }
        }
    ]}'
```

## Recommended Configuration Parameters 

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------------|
| `messages` | - | - | Array of message objects. Important: Avoid system prompts - include all instructions in the user message! |
| `temperature` | 0.6 | 0.0 - 2.0 | Controls randomness in responses. Lower values make responses more deterministic. Recommended range: 0.5-0.7 to prevent repetitions or incoherent outputs |
| `max_completion_tokens` | 1024 | - | Maximum length of model's response. Default may be too low for complex reasoning - consider increasing for detailed step-by-step solutions |
| `top_p` | 0.95 | 0.0 - 1.0 | Controls diversity of token selection |
| `stream` | false | boolean | Enables response streaming. Recommended for interactive reasoning tasks |
| `stop` | null | string/array | Custom stop sequences |
| `seed` | null | integer | Set for reproducible results. Important for benchmarking - run multiple tests with different seeds |
| `response_format` | `{type: "text"}` | `{type: "json_object"}` or `{type: "text"}` | Set to `json_object` type for structured output. |
| `reasoning_format` | `raw` | `"parsed"`, `"raw"`, `"hidden"` | Controls how model reasoning is presented in the response. Must be set to either `parsed` or `hidden` when using tool calls or JSON mode. |
| `reasoning_effort` | `default` | `"none"`, `"default"`, `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"` | Controls the level of effort the model will put into reasoning. `none` and `default` are only supported by [Qwen 3 32B](/docs/model/qwen3-32b). `low`, `medium`, and `high` are only supported by [GPT-OSS 20B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-20b) and [GPT-OSS 120B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-120b). |

## Accessing Reasoning Content

Accessing the reasoning content in the response is dependent on the model and the reasoning format you are using. See the examples below for more details and refer to the [Reasoning Format](#reasoning-format) section for more information.

### Non-GPT-OSS Models


When using `raw` reasoning format, the reasoning content is accessible in the main text content of assistant responses within `<think>` tags. This example demonstrates making a request with `reasoning_format` set to `raw` to see the model's internal thinking process alongside the final answer.

When using `parsed` reasoning format, the model's reasoning is separated into a dedicated `reasoning` field, making it easier to access both the final answer and the thinking process programmatically. This format is ideal for applications that need to process or display reasoning content separately from the main response.

When using `hidden` reasoning format, only the final answer is returned without any visible reasoning content. This is useful for applications where you want the benefits of reasoning models but don't need to expose the thinking process to end users. The model will still reason, but the reasoning content will not be returned in the response.

### GPT-OSS Models

With `openai/gpt-oss-20b` and `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, the `reasoning_format` parameter is not supported.
By default, these models will include reasoning content in the `reasoning` field of the assistant response.
You can also control whether reasoning is included in the response by setting the `include_reasoning` parameter.

## Optimizing Performance 

### Temperature and Token Management
The model performs best with temperature settings between 0.5-0.7, with lower values (closer to 0.5) producing more consistent mathematical proofs and higher values allowing for more creative problem-solving approaches. Monitor and adjust your token usage based on the complexity of your reasoning tasks - while the default max_completion_tokens is 1024, complex proofs may require higher limits.

### Prompt Engineering
To ensure accurate, step-by-step reasoning while maintaining high performance:
- DeepSeek-R1 works best when all instructions are included directly in user messages rather than system prompts. 
- Structure your prompts to request explicit validation steps and intermediate calculations. 
- Avoid few-shot prompting and go for zero-shot prompting only.

## Your Data in GroqCloud

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/your-data

# Your Data in GroqCloud

Understand how Groq uses customer data and the controls you have.

## What Data Groq Retains

Groq handles two distinct types of information:

1. **Usage Metadata (always retained)**  
   * We collect usage metadata for all users to measure service activity and system performance.  
   * This metadata does **not** contain customer inputs or outputs.

2. **Customer Data (retained only in limited circumstances)**  
   * **By default, Groq does not retain customer data for inference requests.**  
   * Customer data (inputs, outputs, and related state) is only retained in two cases:  
     1. **If you use features that require data retention to function** (e.g., batch jobs, fine-tuning and LoRAs).  
     2. **If needed to protect platform reliability** (e.g., to troubleshoot system failures or investigate abuse).

<br />

You can control these settings yourself in the [Data Controls settings](https://console.groq.com/settings/data-controls).

## When Customer Data May Be Retained

Review the [Data Location](#data-location) section below to learn where data is retained. 

### 1. Application State

Certain API features require data retention to function:

* **Batch Processing (`/openai/v1/batches`)**: Input and output files retained for 30 days unless deleted earlier by the customer.  
* **Fine-tuning (`/openai/v1/fine_tunings`)**: Model weights and training datasets retained until deleted by the customer.

To prevent data retention for application state, you can disable these features for all users in your organization in [Data Controls settings](https://console.groq.com/settings/data-controls). 

### 2. System Reliability and Abuse Monitoring

As noted above, inference requests are not retained by default. We may temporarily log inputs and outputs **only when**:

* Troubleshooting errors that degrade platform reliability, or  
* Investigating suspected abuse (e.g. rate-limit circumvention).

These logs are retained for up to **30 days**, unless legally required to retain longer. You may opt out of this storage in [Data Controls settings](https://console.groq.com/settings/data-controls), but you remain responsible for ensuring safe, compliant usage of the services in accordance with [the terms](https://groq.com/terms-of-use) and [Acceptable Use & Responsible AI Policy](/docs/legal/ai-policy).

## Summary Table

| Product | Endpoints | Data Retention Type | Retention Period | ZDR Eligible |
| ------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Inference | `/openai/v1/chat/completions`<br/>`/openai/v1/responses`<br/>`/openai/v1/audio/transcriptions`<br/>`/openai/v1/audio/translations`<br/>`/openai/v1/audio/speech` | System reliability and abuse monitoring | Up to 30 days | Yes |
| Batch | `/openai/v1/batches`<br/>`/openai/v1/files` (purpose: `batch`) | Application state | Up to 30 days | Yes (feature disabled) |
| Fine-tuning | `/openai/v1/fine_tunings`<br/>`/openai/v1/files` (purpose: `fine_tuning`) | Application state | Until deleted | Yes (feature disabled) |

## Zero Data Retention

All customers may enable Zero Data Retention (ZDR) in [Data Controls settings](https://console.groq.com/settings/data-controls).
When ZDR is enabled, Groq will not retain customer data for system reliability and abuse monitoring. As noted above, this also means that features that rely on data retention to function will be disabled. Organization admins can decide to enable ZDR globally or on a per-feature basis at any time on the Data Controls page in [Data Controls settings](https://console.groq.com/settings/data-controls).

## Data Location

All customer data is retained in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) buckets located in the United States. Groq maintains strict access controls and security standards as detailed in the [Groq Trust Center](https://trust.groq.com/). Where applicable, Customers can rely on standard contractual clauses (SCCs) for transfers between third countries and the U.S. 

## Key Takeaways

* **Usage metadata**: always collected, never includes customer data.  
* **Customer data**: not retained by default. Only retained if you opt into persistence features, or in cases for system reliability and abuse monitoring.  
* **Controls**: You can manage data retention in [Data Controls settings](https://console.groq.com/settings/data-controls), including opting into **Zero Data Retention**.

## Browser Search

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/browser-search

# Browser Search

Some models on Groq have built-in support for interactive browser search, providing a more comprehensive approach to accessing real-time web content than traditional web search. Unlike [Web Search](/docs/web-search) which performs a single search and retrieves text snippets from webpages, browser search mimics human browsing behavior by navigating websites interactively, providing more detailed results.

<br />

For latency sensitive use cases, we recommend using [Web Search](/docs/web-search) instead.

The use of this tool with a supported model or system in GroqCloud is not a HIPAA Covered Cloud Service under Groq's Business Associate Addendum at this time. This tool is also not available currently for use with regional / sovereign endpoints.

## Supported Models

Built-in browser search is supported for the following models:

| Model ID                        | Model                          |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| openai/gpt-oss-20b | [OpenAI GPT-OSS 20B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-20b)
| openai/gpt-oss-120b | [OpenAI GPT-OSS 120B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-120b)
| openai/gpt-oss-safeguard-20b | [OpenAI GPT-OSS-Safeguard 20B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-safeguard-20b)

<br/>

**Note:** Browser search is not compatible with [structured outputs](/docs/structured-outputs).

## Quick Start

To use browser search, change the `model` parameter to one of the supported models.

When the API is called, it will use browser search to best answer the user's query. This tool call is performed on the server side, so no additional setup is required on your part to use this feature.

### Final Output

This is the final response from the model, containing snippets from the web pages that were searched, and the final response at the end. The model combines information from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive response.

<br />


## Pricing

Please see the [Pricing](https://groq.com/pricing) page for more information.

## Best Practices

When using browser search with reasoning models, consider setting `reasoning_effort` to `low` to optimize performance and token usage. Higher reasoning effort levels can result in extended browser sessions with more comprehensive web exploration, which may consume significantly more tokens than necessary for most queries. Using `low` reasoning effort provides a good balance between search quality and efficiency.

## Provider Information

Browser search functionality is powered by [Exa](https://exa.ai/), a search engine designed for AI applications. Exa provides comprehensive web browsing capabilities that go beyond traditional search by allowing models to navigate and interact with web content in a more human-like manner.

## 🦜️🔗 LangChain + Groq

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/langchain

## 🦜️🔗 LangChain + Groq

While you could use the Groq SDK directly, [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is a framework that makes it easy to build sophisticated applications 
with LLMs. Combined with Groq API for fast inference speed, you can leverage LangChain components such as:

- **Chains:** Compose multiple operations into a single workflow, connecting LLM calls, prompts, and tools together seamlessly (e.g., prompt → LLM → output parser)
- **Prompt Templates:** Easily manage your prompts and templates with pre-built structures to consisently format queries that can be reused across different models
- **Memory:** Add state to your applications by storing and retrieving conversation history and context 
- **Tools:** Extend your LLM applications with external capabilities like calculations, external APIs, or data retrievals
- **Agents:** Create autonomous systems that can decide which tools to use and how to approach complex tasks


### Quick Start (3 minutes to hello world)

#### 1. Install the package:
```bash
pip install langchain-groq
```

#### 2. Set up your API key:
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
```

#### 3. Create your first LangChain assistant:

Running the below code will create a simple chain that calls a model to extract product information from text and output it
as structured JSON. The chain combines a prompt that tells the model what information to extract, a parser that ensures the output follows a 
specific JSON format, and `llama-3.3-70b-versitable` to do the actual text processing.

```python
from langchain_groq import ChatGroq
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import JsonOutputParser
import json

# Initialize Groq LLM
llm = ChatGroq(
    model_name="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
    temperature=0.7
)

# Define the expected JSON structure
parser = JsonOutputParser(pydantic_object={
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {"type": "string"},
        "price": {"type": "number"},
        "features": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {"type": "string"}
        }
    }
})

# Create a simple prompt
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", """Extract product details into JSON with this structure:
        {{
            "name": "product name here",
            "price": number_here_without_currency_symbol,
            "features": ["feature1", "feature2", "feature3"]
        }}"""),
    ("user", "{input}")
])

# Create the chain that guarantees JSON output
chain = prompt | llm | parser

def parse_product(description: str) -> dict:
    result = chain.invoke({"input": description})
    print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))

        
# Example usage
description = """The Kees Van Der Westen Speedster is a high-end, single-group espresso machine known for its precision, performance, 
and industrial design. Handcrafted in the Netherlands, it features dual boilers for brewing and steaming, PID temperature control for 
consistency, and a unique pre-infusion system to enhance flavor extraction. Designed for enthusiasts and professionals, it offers 
customizable aesthetics, exceptional thermal stability, and intuitive operation via a lever system. The pricing is approximatelyt $14,499 
depending on the retailer and customization options."""

parse_product(description)
```

**Challenge:** Make the above code your own! Try extending it to include memory with conversation history handling via LangChain to enable
users to ask follow-up questions.

The easiest way to use xRx is to start with an example app and customize it. You can either explore the sample apps collection or try our AI voice tutor for calculus that includes a whiteboard and internal math engine.

### Option 1: Sample Apps Collection

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/8090-inc/xrx-sample-apps.git
```
Note: The `--recursive` flag is required as each app uses the xrx-core submodule.

#### 2. Navigate to Sample Apps
```bash
cd xrx-sample-apps
```

#### 3. Choose and Configure an Application
1. Navigate to your chosen app's directory
2. Copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp env-example.txt .env
   ```
3. Configure the required environment variables:
   - Each application has its own set of required variables
   - Check the `.env.example` file in the app's directory
   - Set all required API keys and configuration

> **Tip**: We recommend opening only the specific app folder in your IDE for a cleaner workspace.

#### 4. Follow App-Specific Setup
- Each application has its own README with specific instructions
- Complete any additional setup steps outlined in the app's README
- Ensure all dependencies are properly configured

#### 5. Launch the Application
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
Your app will be available at `localhost:3000`

For detailed instructions and troubleshooting, refer to the README in each application's directory.

### Option 2: AI Voice Tutor

[Math-Tutor on Groq](https://github.com/bklieger-groq/mathtutor-on-groq) is a voice-enabled math tutor powered by Groq that calculates and renders live problems and instruction with LaTeX in seconds! The application demonstrates voice interaction, whiteboard capabilities, and mathematical abilties.

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bklieger-groq/mathtutor-on-groq.git
```

#### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
cp env-example.txt .env
```

Edit `.env` with your API keys:
```bash
LLM_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
GROQ_STT_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your_elevenlabs_api_key"  # For text-to-speech
```

You can obtain:
- Groq API key from the [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com)
- [ElevenLabs API key](https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys) for voice synthesis

#### 3. Launch the Tutor
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
Access the tutor at `localhost:3000`

**Challenge**: Modify the math tutor to teach another topic, such as economics, and accept images of problems as input!

```

## Advanced Examples

### Agent with Tools

Create agents that can use tools with Groq's fast inference:

```typescript agents/tool-agent.ts
const groq = createGroq({ apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY });

const weatherTool = createTool({
  id: 'get_weather',
  description: 'Get current weather for a location',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    location: z.string().describe('City name'),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    // API call to weather service
    return `Weather in ${context.location}: 72°F, sunny`;
  },
});

const weatherAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'Weather Assistant',
  instructions: 'You help users get weather information.',
  model: {
    provider: groq,
    name: 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile',
  },
  tools: { weatherTool },
});
```

### Multi-Step Workflows

Build complex workflows with Groq-powered steps:

```typescript workflows/research-workflow.ts
const searchStep = new Step({
  id: 'search',
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    // Search for information
    return { results: ['result1', 'result2', 'result3'] };
  },
});

const analyzeStep = new Step({
  id: 'analyze',
  execute: async ({ context, mastra }) => {
    const agent = mastra.getAgent('researchAgent');
    const analysis = await agent.generate(
      `Analyze these search results: ${context.results.join(', ')}`
    );
    return { analysis: analysis.text };
  },
});

const summarizeStep = new Step({
  id: 'summarize',
  execute: async ({ context, mastra }) => {
    const agent = mastra.getAgent('researchAgent');
    const summary = await agent.generate(
      `Summarize this analysis: ${context.analysis}`
    );
    return { summary: summary.text };
  },
});

const researchWorkflow = new Workflow({
  name: 'research-workflow',
  triggerSchema: z.object({
    query: z.string(),
  }),
});

researchWorkflow
  .step(searchStep)
  .then(analyzeStep)
  .then(summarizeStep)
  .commit();
```

### Agent with Memory

Add conversation memory to your agents:

```typescript agents/memory-agent.ts
const groq = createGroq({ apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY });

const chatAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'Chat Assistant',
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant that remembers context.',
  model: {
    provider: groq,
    name: 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile',
  },
  enableMemory: true,
});

// Use with thread-based memory
const result = await chatAgent.generate(
  'What did we discuss earlier?',
  {
    threadId: 'user-123',
    resourceId: 'conversation-1',
  }
);
```

### Creating an MCP Server

Build your own MCP server with Mastra:

```typescript mcp/server.ts
const notesTool = createTool({
  id: 'create_note',
  description: 'Create a new note',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    content: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    // Save note to database
    return `Note created: ${context.title}`;
  },
});

const mcpServer = new MCPServer({
  name: 'Notes Server',
  version: '1.0.0',
  tools: { notesTool },
});

// Start the server
await mcpServer.start();
```

### Connecting to MCP Servers

Use external MCP servers in your agents:

```typescript agents/mcp-agent.ts
const exaClient = new MCPClient({
  name: 'exa',
  serverUrl: `https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp?exaApiKey=${process.env.EXA_API_KEY}`,
});

const exaTools = await exaClient.getTools();

const searchAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'Search Agent',
  instructions: 'You help users search the web for information.',
  model: {
    provider: groq,
    name: 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile',
  },
  tools: exaTools,
});
```

## Agent Features

### Streaming Responses

Stream agent responses for real-time feedback:

```typescript
const stream = await researchAgent.stream(
  'Explain quantum computing',
  { threadId: 'user-123' }
);

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  if (chunk.type === 'text-delta') {
    process.stdout.write(chunk.textDelta);
  }
}
```

### Agent Networks

Create multi-agent systems with supervisor patterns:

```typescript
const researcher = new Agent({ /* ... */ });
const writer = new Agent({ /* ... */ });
const editor = new Agent({ /* ... */ });

const supervisor = new Agent({
  name: 'Supervisor',
  model: { provider: groq, name: 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile' },
});

const result = await supervisor.network({
  agents: [researcher, writer, editor],
  prompt: 'Write a research article about AI',
  maxTurns: 5,
});
```

### Guardrails

Add safety checks to agent outputs:

```typescript
const safeAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'Safe Agent',
  model: { provider: groq, name: 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile' },
  guardrails: {
    input: [
      {
        check: (input: string) => !input.includes('harmful'),
        message: 'Input contains harmful content',
      },
    ],
    output: [
      {
        check: (output: string) => output.length < 1000,
        message: 'Output too long',
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

## Workflow Features

### Parallel Execution

Run multiple steps simultaneously:

```typescript
workflow
  .parallel([step1, step2, step3])
  .then(combineResults)
  .commit();
```

### Conditional Branching

Add conditional logic to workflows:

```typescript
workflow
  .step(checkCondition)
  .branch({
    when: (context) => context.needsApproval,
    then: [requestApproval, processApproval],
    else: [autoProcess],
  })
  .commit();
```

### Error Handling

Handle errors gracefully:

```typescript
const step = new Step({
  id: 'risky-operation',
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    // Operation that might fail
  },
  retryConfig: {
    maxRetries: 3,
    delayMs: 1000,
  },
});
```

## Deployment

Mastra provides deployment tools for various platforms:

```bash
# Deploy to Vercel
npm run mastra deploy -- --platform vercel

# Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
npm run mastra deploy -- --platform cloudflare

# Deploy to AWS Lambda
npm run mastra deploy -- --platform aws-lambda
```

Or use the built-in server:

```typescript server.ts
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';
import { agents } from './mastra/agents';
import { workflows } from './mastra/workflows';

const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents,
  workflows,
});

const server = mastra.getServer();

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Mastra server running on port 3000');
});
```

**Challenge:** Build a multi-agent research system that uses Groq for fast inference, coordinates multiple specialized agents (researcher, analyst, writer), maintains conversation memory, and generates comprehensive reports with proper citations!

## CrewAI + Groq: High-Speed Agent Orchestration

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/crewai

## CrewAI + Groq: High-Speed Agent Orchestration

CrewAI is a framework that enables the orchestration of multiple AI agents with specific roles, tools, and goals as a cohesive team to accomplish complex tasks and create sophisticated workflows.

Agentic workflows require fast inference due to their complexity. Groq's fast inference optimizes response times for CrewAI agent teams, enabling rapid autonomous decision-making and collaboration for:

- **Fast Agent Interactions:** Leverage Groq's fast inference speeds via Groq API for efficient agent communication
- **Reliable Performance:** Consistent response times across agent operations
- **Scalable Multi-Agent Systems:** Run multiple agents in parallel without performance degradation
- **Simple Integration:** Get started with just a few lines of code

### Python Quick Start (2 minutes to hello world)
#### 1. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install crewai groq
```
#### 2. Configure your Groq API key:
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```
#### 3. Create your first Groq-powered CrewAI agent:

In CrewAI, **agents** are autonomous entities you can design to perform specific roles and achieve particular goals while **tasks** are specific assignments given to agents that detail the actions they
need to perform to achieve a particular goal. Tools can be assigned as tasks.

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, LLM

# Initialize Large Language Model (LLM) of your choice (see all models on our Models page)
llm = LLM(model="groq/llama-3.1-70b-versatile")

# Create your CrewAI agents with role, main goal/objective, and backstory/personality
summarizer = Agent(
    role='Documentation Summarizer', # Agent's job title/function
    goal='Create concise summaries of technical documentation', # Agent's main objective
    backstory='Technical writer who excels at simplifying complex concepts', # Agent's background/expertise
    llm=llm, # LLM that powers your agent
    verbose=True # Show agent's thought process as it completes its task
)

translator = Agent(
    role='Technical Translator',
    goal='Translate technical documentation to other languages',
    backstory='Technical translator specializing in software documentation',
    llm=llm,
    verbose=True
)

# Define your agents' tasks
summary_task = Task(
    description='Summarize this React hook documentation:\n\nuseFetch(url) is a custom hook for making HTTP requests. It returns { data, loading, error } and automatically handles loading states.',
    expected_output="A clear, concise summary of the hook's functionality",
    agent=summarizer # Agent assigned to task
)

translation_task = Task(
    description='Translate the summary to Turkish',
    expected_output="Turkish translation of the hook documentation",
    agent=translator,
    dependencies=[summary_task] # Must run after the summary task
)

# Create crew to manage agents and task workflow
crew = Crew(
    agents=[summarizer, translator], # Agents to include in your crew
    tasks=[summary_task, translation_task], # Tasks in execution order
    verbose=True
)

result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```

When you run the above code, you'll see that you've created a summarizer agent and a translator agent working together to summarize and translate documentation! This is a simple example to get you started,
but the agents are also able to use tools, which is a powerful combination for building agentic workflows.

**Challenge**: Update the code to add an agent that will write up documentation for functions its given by the user!

### Advanced Model Configuration
For finer control over your agents' responses, you can easily configure additional model parameters. These settings help you balance between creative and deterministic outputs, control response length, 
and manage token usage:
```python
llm = LLM(
    model="llama-3.1-70b-versatile",
    temperature=0.5,
    max_completion_tokens=1024,
    top_p=0.9,
    stop=None,
    stream=False,
)
```

## Spend Limits

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/spend-limits

# Spend Limits

Control your API costs with automated spending limits and proactive usage alerts when approaching budget thresholds.

## Quick Start

**Set a spending limit in 3 steps:**
1. Go to [**Settings** → **Billing** → **Limits**](/settings/billing/limits)
2. Click **Add Limit** and enter your monthly budget in USD
3. Add alert thresholds at 50%, 75%, and 90% of your limit
4. Click **Save** to activate the limit

**Requirements:** Paid tier account with organization owner permissions.

## How It Works

Spend limits automatically protect your budget by blocking API access when you reach your monthly cap. The limit applies organization-wide across all API keys, so usage from any team member or application counts toward the same shared limit. If you hit your set limit, API calls from any key in your organization will return a 400 with code `blocked_api_access`. Usage alerts notify you via email before you hit the limit, giving you time to adjust usage or increase your budget. 
<br />
This feature offers:

- **Near real-time tracking:** Your current spend updates every 10-15 minutes  
- **Automatic monthly reset:** Limits reset at the beginning of each billing cycle (1st of the month)  
- **Immediate blocking:** API access is blocked when a spend update detects you've hit your limit

<br/>
> ⚠️ **Important:** There's a 10-15 minute delay in spend tracking. This means you might exceed your limit by a small amount during high usage periods.

## Setting Up Spending Limits

### Create a Spending Limit

Navigate to [**Settings** → **Billing** → **Limits**](/settings/billing/limits) and click **Add Limit**.

Example Monthly Spending Limit: $500

Your API requests will be blocked when you reach $500 in monthly usage. The limit resets automatically on the 1st of each month.

### Add Usage Alerts

Set up email notifications before you hit your limit:
Alert at $250 (50% of limit)
Alert at $375 (75% of limit)
Alert at $450 (90% of limit)

**To add an alert:**
1. Click **Add Alert** in the Usage Alerts section
2. Enter the USD amount trigger
3. Click **Save**

Alerts appear as visual markers on your spending progress bar on Groq Console Limits page under Billing.

### Manage Your Alerts

- **Edit Limit:** Click the pencil icon next to any alert
- **Delete:** Click the trash icon to remove an alert
- **Multiple alerts:** Add as many thresholds as needed

## Email Notifications

All spending alerts and limit notifications are sent from **support@groq.com** to your billing email addresses.

**Update billing emails:**
1. Go to [**Settings** → **Billing** → **Manage**](/settings/billing)
2. Add or update email addresses
3. Return to the Limits page to confirm the changes

**Pro tip:** Add multiple team members to billing emails so important notifications don't get missed.

## Best Practices

### Setting Effective Limits

- **Start conservative:** Set your first limit 20-30% above your expected monthly usage to account for variability.

- **Monitor patterns:** Review your usage for 2-3 months, then adjust limits based on actual consumption patterns.

- **Leave buffer room:** Don't set limits exactly at your expected usage—unexpected spikes can block critical API access.

- **Use multiple thresholds:** Set alerts at 50%, 75%, and 90% of your limit to get progressive warnings.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Access the Limits Page?

- **Check your account tier:** Spending limits are only available on paid plans, not free tier accounts.

- **Verify permissions:** You need organization owner permissions to manage spending limits.

- **Feature availability:** Contact us via support@groq.com if you're on a paid tier but don't see the spending limits feature.

### Not Receiving Alert Emails?

- **Verify email addresses:** Check that your billing emails are correct in [**Settings** → **Billing** → **Manage**](/settings/billing).

- **Check spam folders:** Billing alerts might be filtered by your email provider.

- **Test notifications:** Set a low-dollar test alert to verify email delivery is working.

### API Access Blocked?

- **Check your spending status:** The [limits page](/settings/billing/limits) shows your current spend against your limit.

- **Increase your limit:** You can raise your spending limit at any time to restore immediate access if you've hit your spend limit. You can also remove it to unblock your API access immediately.

- **Wait for reset:** If you've hit your limit, API access will restore on the 1st of the next month.


## FAQ

**Q: Can I set different limits for different API endpoints or API keys?**  
A: No, spending limits are organization-wide and apply to your total monthly usage across all API endpoints and all API keys in your organization. All team members and applications using your organization's API keys share the same spending limit.

<br />

**Q: What happens to in-flight requests when I hit my limit?**  
A: In-flight requests complete normally, but new requests are blocked immediately.

<br />

**Q: Can I set weekly or daily spending limits?**  
A: Currently, only monthly limits are supported. Limits reset on the 1st of each month.

<br />

**Q: How accurate is the spending tracking?**  
A: Spending is tracked in near real-time with a 10-15 minute delay. The delay prevents brief usage spikes from prematurely triggering limits.

<br />

**Q: Can I temporarily disable my spending limit?**  
A: Yes, you can edit or remove your spending limit at any time from the limits page.

## API Error Codes and Responses

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/errors

# API Error Codes and Responses

Our API uses standard HTTP response status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In cases of errors, the body of the response will contain a JSON object with details about the error. Below are the error codes you may encounter, along with their descriptions and example response bodies.

## Success Codes

- **200 OK**: The request was successfully executed. No further action is needed.

## Client Error Codes

- **400 Bad Request**: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax. Review the request format and ensure it is correct.
- **401 Unauthorized**: The request was not successful because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the requested resource. Ensure the request includes the necessary authentication credentials and the api key is valid.
- **403 Forbidden**: The request is not allowed due to permission restrictions. Ensure the request includes the necessary permissions to access the resource or that your permissions are configured correctly to make a request to the resource.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found. Check the request URL and the existence of the resource.
- **413 Request Entity Too Large**: The request body is too large. Please reduce the size of the request body.
- **422 Unprocessable Entity**: The request was well-formed, but could not be followed due to semantic errors or model hallucinations. Verify the data provided for correctness and completeness or retry your request.
- **424 Failed Dependency**: The request failed because the dependent request failed. This may occur when using [Remote MCP](/docs/mcp) in the case of authentication issues.
- **429 Too Many Requests**: Too many requests were sent in a given timeframe. Implement request throttling and respect rate limits.
- **498 Custom: Flex Tier Capacity Exceeded**: This is a custom status code we use and will return in the event that the flex tier is at capacity and the request won't be processed. You can try again later.
- **499 Custom: Request Cancelled**: This is a custom status code we use in our logs page to signify when the request is cancelled by the caller.

## Server Error Codes

- **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error occurred on the server. Try the request again later or contact support if the issue persists.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server. This may be a temporary issue; retrying the request might resolve it.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is not ready to handle the request, often due to maintenance or overload. Wait before retrying the request.

## Informational Codes

- **206 Partial Content**: Only part of the resource is being delivered, usually in response to range headers sent by the client. Ensure this is expected for the request being made.

## Error Object Explanation

When an error occurs, our API returns a structured error object containing detailed information about the issue. This section explains the components of the error object to aid in troubleshooting and error handling.

## Error Object Structure

The error object follows a specific structure, providing a clear and actionable message alongside an error type classification:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "String - description of the specific error",
    "type": "invalid_request_error"
  }
}
```

## Components

- **`error` (object):** The primary container for error details.
  - **`message` (string):** A descriptive message explaining the nature of the error, intended to aid developers in diagnosing the problem.
  - **`type` (string):** A classification of the error type, such as `"invalid_request_error"`, indicating the general category of the problem encountered.

## Toolhouse 🛠️🏠

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/toolhouse

## Toolhouse 🛠️🏠
[Toolhouse](https://toolhouse.ai) is the first Backend-as-a-Service for the agentic stack. Toolhouse allows you to define agents as configuration, and to deploy them as APIs. Toolhouse agents are automatically connected to 40+ tools including RAG, MCP servers, web search, webpage readers, memory, storage, statefulness and more. With Toolhouse, you can build both conversational and autonomous agents without the need to host and maintain your own infrastructure.

You can use Groq’s fast inference with Toolhouse. This page shows you how to use Llama 4 Maverick and Groq’s Compound Beta to build a Toolhouse agent.

### Getting Started

#### Step 1: Download the Toolhouse CLI

Download the Toolhouse CLI by typing this command on your Terminal:

```bash
npm i -g @toolhouseai/cli
```

#### Step 2: Log into Toolhouse

Log into Toolhouse via the CLI:

```bash
th login
```

Follow the instructions to create a free Sandbox account.

#### Step 3: Add your Groq API Key to Toolhouse

Generate a Groq API Key in your [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys), then copy its value.

In the CLI, set your Groq API Key:

```bash
th secrets set GROQ_API_KEY=(replace this with your Groq API Key)
```

You’re all set! From now on, you’ll be able to use Groq models with your Toolhouse agents. For a list of supported models, refer to the [Toolhouse models page](https://docs.toolhouse.ai/toolhouse/bring-your-model#supported-models).

## Using Toolhouse with Llama 4 models

To use a specific model, simply reference the model identifier in your agent file, for example:

- For Llama 4 Maverick: `@groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct`
- For Llama 4 Scout: `@groq/meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`

Here’s an example of a working agent file. You can copy this file and save it as `groq.yaml` . In this example, we use an image generation tool, along with Maverick.

```yaml
title: "Maverick Example"
prompt: "Tell me a joke about this topic: {topic} then generate an image!"
vars:
  topic: "bananas"
model: "@groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct"
public: true
```

Then, run it:

```yaml
th run groq.yaml
```

You will see something like this:

```bash
━━━━ Stream output for joke ━━━━
Why did the banana go to the doctor? Because it wasn't peeling well!

Using MCP Server: image_generation_flux()

Why did the banana go to the doctor? Because it wasn't peeling well!

![](https://img.toolhouse.ai/tbR5NI.jpg)
━━━━ End of stream for joke ━━━━
```

If the results look good to you, you can deploy this agent using `th deploy groq.yaml`

## Using Toolhouse with Compound Beta

Compound Beta is an advanced AI system that is designed to agentically [search the web and execute code](/docs/agentic-tooling), while being optimized for latency.

To use Compound Beta, simply specify `@groq/compound-beta` or `@groq/compound-beta-mini` as the model identifier. In this example, Compound Beta will search the web under the hood. Save the following file as `groq.yaml`:

```yaml
title: Compound Example
prompt: Who are the Oilers playing against next, and when/where are they playing? Use the current_time() tool to get the current time.
model: "@groq/compound-beta"
```

Run it with the following command:

```bash
th run compound.yaml
```

You will see something like this:

```bash
━━━━ Stream output for compound ━━━━
The Oilers are playing against the Florida Panthers next. The game is scheduled for June 12, 2025, at Amerant Bank Arena.
━━━━ End of stream for compound ━━━━
```

Then to deploy the agent as an API: 

```bash
th deploy
```

## Flex Processing

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/flex-processing

# Flex Processing
Flex Processing is a service tier optimized for high-throughput workloads that prioritizes fast inference and can handle occasional request failures. This tier offers significantly higher rate limits while maintaining the same pricing as on-demand processing during beta.

## Availability 
Flex processing is available for all [models](/docs/models) to paid customers only with 10x higher rate limits compared to on-demand processing. While in beta, pricing will remain the same as our on-demand tier.

## Service Tiers
- **On-demand (`"service_tier":"on_demand"`):** The on-demand tier is the default tier and the one you are used to. We have kept rate limits low in order to ensure fairness and a consistent experience.
- **Flex (`"service_tier":"flex"`):** The flex tier offers on-demand processing when capacity is available, with rapid timeouts if resources are constrained. This tier is perfect for workloads that prioritize fast inference and can gracefully handle occasional request failures. It provides an optimal balance between performance and reliability for workloads that don't require guaranteed processing.
- **Auto (`"service_tier":"auto"`):** The auto tier uses on-demand rate limits, then falls back to flex tier if those limits are exceeded.

## Using Service Tiers

### Service Tier Parameter
The `service_tier` parameter is an additional, optional parameter that you can include in your chat completion request to specify the service tier you'd like to use. The possible values are:
| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `flex` | Only uses flex tier limits |
| `on_demand` (default) | Only uses on_demand rate limits |
| `auto` | First uses on_demand rate limits, then falls back to flex tier if exceeded |


## Example Usage

### Service Tier Parameter
The `service_tier` parameter is an additional, optional parameter that you can include in your chat completion request to specify the service tier you'd like to use. The possible values are:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `flex` | Only uses flex tier limits |
| `on_demand` (default) | Only uses on_demand rate limits |
| `auto` | First uses on_demand rate limits, then falls back to flex tier if exceeded |

## Text Generation

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/text-chat

# Text Generation

Generating text with Groq's Chat Completions API enables you to have natural, conversational interactions with Groq's large language models. It processes a series of messages and generates human-like responses that can be used for various applications including conversational agents, content generation, task automation, and generating structured data outputs like JSON for your applications.

## Chat Completions

Chat completions allow your applications to have dynamic interactions with Groq's models. You can send messages that include user inputs and system instructions, and receive responses that match the conversational context.
<br />
Chat models can handle both multi-turn discussions (conversations with multiple back-and-forth exchanges) and single-turn tasks where you need just one response.
<br />
For details about all available parameters, [visit the API reference page.](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#chat-create)

### Getting Started with Groq SDK

To start using Groq's Chat Completions API, you'll need to install the [Groq SDK](/docs/libraries) and set up your [API key](https://console.groq.com/keys).

## Performing a Basic Chat Completion

The simplest way to use the Chat Completions API is to send a list of messages and receive a single response. Messages are provided in chronological order, with each message containing a role ("system", "user", or "assistant") and content.

## Streaming a Chat Completion

For a more responsive user experience, you can stream the model's response in real-time. This allows your application to display the response as it's being generated, rather than waiting for the complete response.

To enable streaming, set the parameter `stream=True`. The completion function will then return an iterator of completion deltas rather than a single, full completion.

## Performing a Chat Completion with a Stop Sequence

Stop sequences allow you to control where the model should stop generating. When the model encounters any of the specified stop sequences, it will halt generation at that point. This is useful when you need responses to end at specific points.

## Performing an Async Chat Completion

For applications that need to maintain responsiveness while waiting for completions, you can use the asynchronous client. This lets you make non-blocking API calls using Python's asyncio framework.

### Streaming an Async Chat Completion

You can combine the benefits of streaming and asynchronous processing by streaming completions asynchronously. This is particularly useful for applications that need to handle multiple concurrent conversations.

## Structured Outputs and JSON

Need reliable, type-safe JSON responses that match your exact schema? Groq's Structured Outputs feature is designed so that model responses strictly conform to your JSON Schema without validation or retry logic.

<br/>

For complete guides on implementing structured outputs with JSON Schema or using JSON Object Mode, see our [structured outputs documentation](/docs/structured-outputs).

<br/>

Key capabilities:
- **JSON Schema enforcement**: Responses match your schema exactly
- **Type-safe outputs**: No validation or retry logic needed
- **Programmatic refusal detection**: Handle safety-based refusals programmatically
- **JSON Object Mode**: Basic JSON output with prompt-guided structure

## Prompt Engineering Patterns Guide

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/prompting/patterns

# Prompt Engineering Patterns Guide

This guide provides a systematic approach to selecting appropriate prompt patterns for various tasks when working with open-source language models. Implementing the correct pattern significantly improves output reliability and performance.

## Why Patterns Matter
Prompt patterns serve distinct purposes in language model interactions:

- **Zero shot** provides instructions without examples, relying on the model's existing knowledge.
- **Few shot** demonstrates specific examples for the model to follow as templates.
- **Chain of Thought** breaks complex reasoning into sequential steps for methodical problem-solving.

Selecting the appropriate pattern significantly improves output accuracy, consistency, and reliability across applications.

## Pattern Chooser Table

The table below helps you quickly identify the most effective prompt pattern for your specific task, matching common use cases with optimal approaches to maximize model performance.

| Task Type | Recommended Pattern | Why it works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Simple Q&A, definitions | [**Zero shot**](#zero-shot) | Model already knows; instructions suffice |
| Extraction / classification | [**Few shot (1-3 samples)**](#one-shot--few-shot) | Teaches exact labels & JSON keys |
| Creative writing | [**Zero shot + role**](#zero-shot) | Freedom + persona = coherent style |
| Multi-step math / logic | [**Chain of Thought**](#chain-of-thought) | Forces stepwise reasoning |
| Edge-case heavy tasks | [**Few shot (2-5 samples)**](#one-shot--few-shot) | Covers exceptions & rare labels |
| Mission-critical accuracy | [**Guided CoT + Self Consistency**](#guided-cot--self-consistency) | Multiple reasoned paths to a consensus |
| Tool-use / knowledge-heavy tasks | [**ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)**](#react-reasoning-and-acting) | Thinks, calls tools, repeats for grounded solutions.  |
| Concise yet comprehensive summarization | [**Chain of Density (CoD)**](#chain-of-density-cod) | Stepwise compression keeps essentials, cuts fluff. |
| Accuracy-critical facts | [**Chain of Verification (CoVe)**](#chain-of-verification-cove) | Asks and answers its own checks, then fixes. |

## Customer Support Ticket Processing Use Case

Throughout this guide, we'll use the practical example of automating customer support ticket processing. This enterprise-relevant use case demonstrates how different prompt patterns can improve:
 - Initial ticket triage and categorization
 - Issue urgency assessment
 - Information extraction from customer communications
 - Resolution suggestions and draft responses
 - Ticket summarization for team handoffs

Using AI to enhance support ticket processing can reduce agent workload, accelerate response times, ensure consistent handling, and enable better tracking of common issues. Each prompt pattern offers distinct advantages for specific aspects of the support workflow.

## Zero Shot

Zero shot prompting tells a large-language model **exactly what you want without supplying a single demonstration**. The model leans on the general-purpose knowledge it absorbed during pre-training to infer the right output. You provide instructions but no examples, allowing the model to apply its existing understanding to the task.

### When to use

| Use case | Why Zero Shot works |
| --- | --- |
| **Sentiment classification** | Model has seen millions of examples during training; instructions suffice |
| **Basic information extraction** (e.g., support ticket triage) | Simple extraction of explicit data points requires minimal guidance |
| **Urgent support ticket assessment** | Clear indicators of urgency are typically explicit in customer language |
| **Standard content formatting** | Straightforward style adjustments like formalization or simplification |
| **Language translation** | Well-established task with clear inputs and outputs |
| **Content outlines and summaries** | Follows common structural patterns; benefits from brevity |

### Support Ticket Zero Shot Example

This example demonstrates using zero shot prompting to quickly analyze a customer support ticket for essential information.

## One Shot & Few Shot

A **one shot prompt** includes exactly one worked example; a **few shot prompt** provides several (typically 3-8) examples. Both rely on the model's in-context learning to imitate the demonstrated input to output mapping. Because the demonstrations live in the prompt, you get the benefits of "training" without fine-tuning: you can swap tasks or tweak formats instantly by editing examples.

### When to use

| Use case | Why One/Few Shot works |
| --- | --- |
| **Structured output (JSON, SQL, XML)** | Examples nail the exact keys, quoting, or delimiters you need |
| **Support ticket categorization** with nuanced or custom labels | A few examples teach proper categorization schemes specific to your organization |
| **Domain-specific extraction** from technical support tickets | Demonstrations anchor the terminology and extraction patterns |
| **Edge-case handling** for unusual tickets | Show examples of tricky inputs to teach disambiguation strategies |
| **Consistent formatting** of support responses | Examples ensure adherence to company communication standards |
| **Custom urgency criteria** based on business rules | Examples demonstrate how to apply organization-specific Service Level Agreement (SLA) definitions |

### Support Ticket Few Shot Example

This example demonstrates using few shot prompting to extract detailed, structured information from support tickets according to a specific schema.

## Chain of Thought

Chain of Thought (CoT) is a prompt engineering technique that explicitly instructs the model to think through a problem step-by-step before producing the answer. In its simplest form you add a phrase like **"Let's think step by step."** This cue triggers the model to emit a sequence of reasoning statements (the "chain") followed by a conclusion. Zero shot CoT works effectively on arithmetic and commonsense questions, while few shot CoT supplies handcrafted exemplars for more complex domains.

### When to use

| Problem type | Why CoT helps |
| --- | --- |
| **Math & logic word problems** | Forces explicit arithmetic steps |
| **Multi-hop Q&A / retrieval** | Encourages sequential evidence gathering |
| **Complex support ticket analysis** | Breaks down issue diagnosis into logical components |
| **Content plans & outlines** | Structures longform content creation |
| **Policy / safety analysis** | Documents each step of reasoning for transparency |
| **Ticket priority determination** | Systematically assesses impact, urgency, and SLA considerations |

### Support Ticket Chain of Thought Example

This example demonstrates using CoT to systematically analyze a customer support ticket to extract detailed information and make reasoned judgments about the issue.

## Guided CoT & Self Consistency

Guided CoT provides a structured outline of reasoning steps for the model to follow. Rather than letting the model determine its own reasoning path, you explicitly define the analytical framework.

<br />

Self-Consistency replaces standard decoding in CoT with a sample-and-majority-vote strategy: the same CoT prompt is run multiple times with a higher temperature, the answer from each chain is extracted, then the most common answer is returned as the final result.

### When to use

| Use case | Why it works |
| --- | --- |
| **Support ticket categorization** with complex business rules | Guided CoT ensures consistent application of classification criteria |
| **SLA breach determination** with multiple factors | Self-Consistency reduces calculation errors in deadline computations |
| **Risk assessment** of customer issues | Multiple reasoning paths help identify edge cases in potential impact analysis |
| **Customer sentiment analysis** in ambiguous situations | Consensus across multiple paths provides more reliable interpretation |
| **Root cause analysis** for technical issues | Guided steps ensure thorough investigation across all system components |
| **Draft response generation** for sensitive issues | Self-Consistency helps avoid inappropriate or inadequate responses |

## ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)

ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) is a prompt pattern that instructs an LLM to generate two interleaved streams:

1. **Thought / reasoning trace** - natural-language reflection on the current state
2. **Action** - a structured command that an external tool executes (e.g., `Search[query]`, `Calculator[expression]`, or `Call_API[args]`) followed by the tool's observation

Because the model can observe the tool's response and continue thinking, it forms a closed feedback loop. The model assesses the situation, takes an action to gather information, processes the results, and repeats if necessary.

### When to use

| Use case | Why ReAct works |
| --- | --- |
| **Support ticket triage requiring contextual knowledge** | Enables lookup of error codes, known issues, and solutions |
| **Ticket analysis needing real-time status checks** | Can verify current system status and outage information |
| **SLA calculation and breach determination** | Performs precise time calculations with Python execution |
| **Customer history-enriched responses** | Retrieves customer context from knowledge bases or documentation |
| **Technical troubleshooting with diagnostic tools** | Runs diagnostic scripts and interprets results |
| **Product-specific error resolution** | Searches documentation and knowledge bases for specific error codes |

## Chain of Verification (CoVe)

Chain of Verification (CoVe) prompting turns the model into its own fact-checker. It follows a four-phase process: first writing a draft analysis, then planning targeted verification questions, answering those questions independently to avoid bias, and finally producing a revised, "verified" response. This technique can reduce error rates significantly across knowledge-heavy tasks while adding only one extra round-trip latency.

### When to use

| Use case | Why CoVe works |
| --- | --- |
| **Support ticket categorization auditing** | Verifies proper categorization through targeted questions |
| **SLA calculation verification** | Double-checks time calculations and policy interpretation |
| **Technical troubleshooting validation** | Confirms logical connections between symptoms and causes |
| **Customer response quality assurance** | Ensures completeness and accuracy of draft responses |
| **Incident impact assessment** | Validates estimates of business impact through specific questions |
| **Error code interpretation** | Cross-checks error code explanations against known documentation |

## Chain of Density (CoD)

Chain of Density (CoD) is an iterative summarization technique that begins with a deliberately entity-sparse draft and progressively adds key entities while maintaining a fixed length. In each round, the model identifies 1-3 new entities it hasn't mentioned, then rewrites the summary: compressing existing text to make room for them. After several iterations, the summary achieves a higher entity-per-token density, reducing lead bias and often matching or exceeding human summaries in informativeness.

### When to use

| Use case | Why CoD works |
| --- | --- |
| **Support ticket executive summaries** | Creates highly informative briefs within strict length limits |
| **Agent handover notes** | Ensures all critical details are captured in a concise format |
| **Knowledge base entry creation** | Progressively incorporates technical details without increasing length |
| **Customer communication summaries** | Balances completeness with brevity for customer record notes |
| **SLA/escalation notifications** | Packs essential details into notification character limits |
| **Support team daily digests** | Summarizes multiple tickets with key details for management review |

## Prompt Basics

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/prompting

# Prompt Basics

Prompting is the methodology through which we communicate instructions, parameters, and expectations to large language models. Consider a prompt as a detailed specification document provided to the model: the more precise and comprehensive the specifications, the higher the quality of the output. This guide establishes the fundamental principles for crafting effective prompts for open-source instruction-tuned models, including Llama, Deepseek, and Gemma.

## Why Prompts Matter

Large language models require clear direction to produce optimal results. Without precise instructions, they may produce inconsistent outputs. Well-structured prompts provide several benefits:

- **Reduce development time** by minimizing iterations needed for acceptable results.
- **Enhance output consistency** to ensure responses meet validation requirements without modification.
- **Optimize resource usage** by maintaining efficient context window utilization.

## Prompt Building Blocks

Most high-quality prompts contain five elements: **role, instructions, context, input, expected output**.

| Element | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Role** | Sets persona or expertise ("You are a data analyst…") |
| **Instructions** | Bullet-proof list of required actions |
| **Context** | Background knowledge or reference material |
| **Input** | The data or question to transform |
| **Expected Output** | Schema or miniature example to lock formatting |

### Real-world use case

Here's a real-world example demonstrating how these prompt building blocks work together to extract structured data from an email. Each element plays a crucial role in ensuring accurate, consistent output:

1. **System** - fixes the model's role so it doesn't add greetings or extra formatting.
2. **Instructions** - lists the exact keys; pairing this with [JSON mode](/docs/structured-outputs#json-object-mode) or [tool use](/docs/tool-use) further guarantees parseable output.
3. **Context** - gives domain hints ("Deliver to", postcode format) that raise extraction accuracy without extra examples.
4. **Input** - the raw e-mail; keep original line breaks so the model can latch onto visual cues.
5. **Example Output** - a miniature few-shot sample that locks the reply shape to one JSON object.

## Role Channels

Most chat-style APIs expose **three channels**:

| Channel | Typical Use |
| --- | --- |
| `system` | High-level persona & non-negotiable rules ("You are a helpful financial assistant."). |
| `user` | The actual request or data, such as a user's message in a chat. |
| `assistant` | The model's response. In multi-turn conversations, the assistant role can be used to track the conversation history. |

The following example demonstrates how to implement a customer service chatbot using role channels. Role channels provide a structured way for the model to maintain context and generate contextually appropriate responses throughout the conversation.

## Prompt Priming

Prompt priming is the practice of giving the model an **initial block of instructions or context** that influences every downstream token the model generates.  Think of it as "setting the temperature of the conversation room" before anyone walks in. This usually lives in the **system** message; in single-shot prompts it's the first paragraph you write. Unlike one- or few-shot demos, priming does not need examples; the power comes from describing roles ("You are a medical billing expert"), constraints ("never reveal PII"), or seed knowledge ("assume the user's database is Postgres 16").

### Why it Works

Large language models generate text by conditioning on **all previous tokens**, weighting earlier tokens more heavily than later ones.  By positioning high-leverage tokens (role, style, rules) first, priming biases the probability distribution over next tokens toward answers that respect that frame.

### Example (Primed Chat)

## Core Principles

1. **Lead with the must-do.** Put critical instructions first; the model weighs early tokens more heavily.
2. **Show, don't tell.** A one-line schema or table example beats a paragraph of prose.
3. **State limits explicitly.** Use "Return **only** JSON" or "less than 75 words" to eliminate chatter.
4. **Use plain verbs.** "Summarize in one bullet per metric" is clearer than "analyze."
5. **Chunk long inputs.** Delimit data with ``` or \<\<\< … \>\>\> so the model sees clear boundaries.

## Context Budgeting

While many models can handle up to **128K** tokens (or more), using a longer system prompt still costs latency and money. While you might be able to fit a lot of information in the model's context window, it could increase latency and reduce the model's accuracy. As a best practice, only include what is needed for the model to generate the desired response in the context.

## Quick Prompting Wins

Try these **10-second tweaks** before adding examples or complex logic:

| Quick Fix | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Add a one-line persona (*"You are a veteran copy editor."*) | Sharper, domain-aware tone |
| Show a mini output sample (one-row table / tiny JSON) | Increased formatting accuracy |
| Use numbered steps in instructions | Reduces answers with extended rambling |
| Add "no extra prose" at the end | Stops model from adding greetings or apologies |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
Review these recommended practices and solutions to avoid common prompting issues.

| Common Mistake | Result | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hidden ask** buried mid-paragraph | Model ignores it | Move all instructions to top bullet list |
| **Over-stuffed context** | Truncated or slow responses | Summarize, remove old examples |
| **Ambiguous verbs** (*"analyze"*) | Vague output | Be explicit (*"Summarize in one bullet per metric"*) |
| **Partial JSON keys** in sample | Model Hallucinates extra keys | Show the **full** schema: even if brief |

## Parameter Tuning
Optimize model outputs by configuring key parameters like temperature and top-p. These settings control the balance between deterministic and creative responses, with recommended values based on your specific use case.

| Parameter | What it does | Safe ranges | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Temperature** | Global randomness (higher = more creative) | 0 - 1.0 | 0 - 0.3 facts, 0.7 - 0.9 creative |
| **Top-p** | Keeps only the top p cumulative probability mass - use this or temperature, not both | 0.5 - 1.0 | 0.9 facts, 1.0 creative |
| **Top-k** | Limits to the k highest-probability tokens | 20 - 100 | Rarely needed; try k = 40 for deterministic extraction |

### Quick presets

The following are recommended values to set temperature or top-p to (but not both) for various use cases:

| Scenario | Temp | Top-p | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Factual Q&A | 0.2 | 0.9 | Keeps dates & numbers stable |
| Data extraction (JSON) | 0.0 | 0.9 | Deterministic keys/values |
| Creative copywriting | 0.8 | 1.0 | Vivid language, fresh ideas |
| Brainstorming list | 0.7 | 0.95 | Variety without nonsense |
| Long-form code | 0.3 | 0.85 | Fewer hallucinated APIs |

## Controlling Length & Cost

The following are recommended settings for controlling token usage and costs with length limits, stop sequences, and deterministic outputs.

| Setting | Purpose | Tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `max_completion_tokens` | Hard cap on completion size | Set 10-20 % above ideal answer length |
| Stop sequences | Early stop when model hits token(s) | Use `"###"` or another delimiter |
| System length hints | "less than 75 words" or "return only table rows" | Model respects explicit numbers |
| `seed` | Controls randomness deterministically | Use same seed for consistent outputs across runs |

## Guardrails & Safety

Good prompts set the rules; dedicated guardrail models enforce them. [Meta's **Llama Guard 4**](/docs/content-moderation) is designed to sit in front of: or behind: your main model, classifying prompts or outputs for safety violations (hate, self-harm, private data). Integrating a moderation step can cut violation rates without changing your core prompt structure.

## Next Steps

Ready to level up? Explore dedicated [**prompt patterns**](/docs/prompting/patterns) like zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and more to match the pattern to your task complexity. From there, iterate and refine to improve your prompts.

## Model Migration Guide

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/prompting/model-migration

# Model Migration Guide

Migrating prompts from commercial models (GPT, Claude, Gemini) to open-source ones like Llama often requires explicitly including instructions that might have been implicitly handled in proprietary systems. This migration typically involves adjusting prompting techniques to be more explicit, matching generation parameters, and testing outputs to help with iteratively adjust prompts until the desired outputs are reached.

## Migration Principles

1. **Surface hidden rules:** Proprietary model providers prepend their closed-source models with system messages that are not explicitly shared with the end user; you must create clear system messages to get consistent outputs.
2. **Start from parity, not aspiration:** Match parameters such as temperature, Top P, and max tokens first, then focus on adjusting your prompts.
3. **Automate the feedback loop:** We recommend using open-source tooling like prompt optimizers instead of manual trial-and-error.

## Aligning System Behavior and Tone

Closed-source models are often prepended with elaborate system prompts that enforce politeness, hedging, legal disclaimers, policies, and more, that are not shown to the end user. To ensure consistency and lead open-source models to generate desired outputs, create a comprehensive system prompt:

You are a courteous support agent for AcmeCo.
Always greet with "Certainly: here's the information you requested:".
Refuse medical or legal advice; direct users to professionals.

## Sampling / Parameter Parity

No matter which model you're migrating from, having explicit control over temperature and other sampling parameters matters a lot. First, determine what temperature your source model defaults to (often 1.0). Then experiment to find what works best for your specific use case - many Llama deployments see better results with temperatures between 0.2-0.4. The key is to start with parity, measure the results, then adjust deliberately:

| Parameter | Closed-Source Models | Llama Models | Suggested Adjustments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `temperature` | 1.0 | 0.7 | Lower for factual answers and strict schema adherence (eg. JSON) |
| `top_p` | 1.0 | 1.0 | leave 1.0 |

## Refactoring Prompts
In some cases, you'll need to refactor your prompts to use explicit [Prompt Patterns](/docs/prompting/patterns) since different models have varying pre- and post-training that can affect how they function. For example:

- Some models, such as [those that can reason](/docs/reasoning), might naturally break down complex problems, while others may need explicit instructions to "think step by step" using [Chain of Thought](/docs/prompting/patterns#chain-of-thought) prompting
- Where some models automatically verify facts, others might need [Chain of Verification](/docs/prompting/patterns#chain-of-verification-cove) to achieve similar accuracy
- When certain models explore multiple solution paths by default, you can achieve similar results with [Self-Consistency](/docs/prompting/patterns#self-consistency) voting across multiple completions

The key is being more explicit about the reasoning process you want. Instead of:

"Calculate the compound interest over 5 years"

Use:

"Let's solve this step by step:
1. First, write out the compound interest formula
2. Then, plug in our values
3. Calculate each year's interest separately
4. Sum the total and verify the math"

This explicit guidance helps open models match the sophisticated reasoning that closed models learn through additional training.

### Migrating from Claude (Anthropic)

Claude models from Anthropic are known for their conversational abilities, safety features, and detailed reasoning. Claude's system prompts are available [here](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/release-notes/system-prompts). When migrating from Claude to an open-source model like Llama, creating a system prompt with the following instructions to maintain similar behavior:

| Instruction | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Set a clear persona | "I am a helpful, multilingual, and proactive assistant ready to guide this conversation." |
| Specify tone & style | "Be concise and warm. Avoid bullet or numbered lists unless explicitly requested." |
| Limit follow-up questions | "Ask at most one concise clarifying question when needed." |
| Embed reasoning directive | "For tasks that need analysis, think step-by-step in a Thought: section, then provide Answer: only." |
| Insert counting rule | "Enumerate each item with #1, #2 ... before giving totals." |
| Provide a brief accuracy notice | "Information on niche or very recent topics may be incomplete—verify externally." |
| Define refusal template | "If a request breaches guidelines, reply: 'I'm sorry, but I can't help with that.'" |
| Mirror user language | "Respond in the same language the user uses." |
| Reinforce empathy | "Express sympathy when the user shares difficulties; maintain a supportive tone." |
| Control token budget | Keep the final system block under 2,000 tokens to preserve user context. |
| Web search | Use [Agentic Tooling](/docs/agentic-tooling) for built-in web search. |

### Migrating from Grok (xAI)

Grok models from xAI are known for their conversational abilities, real-time knowledge, and engaging personality. Grok's system prompts are available [here](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-prompts). When migrating from Grok to an open-source model like Llama, creating a system prompt with the following instructions to maintain similar behavior:

| Instruction | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Language parity | "Detect the user's language and respond in the same language." |
| Structured style | "Write in short paragraphs; use numbered or bulleted lists for multiple points." |
| Formatting guard | "Do not output Markdown (or only the Markdown elements you permit)." |
| Length ceiling | "Keep the answer below 750 characters" and enforce `max_completion_tokens` in the API call. |
| Epistemic stance | "Adopt a neutral, evidence-seeking tone; challenge unsupported claims; express uncertainty when facts are unclear." |
| Draft-versus-belief rule | "Treat any supplied analysis text as provisional research, not as established fact." |
| No meta-references | "Do not mention the question, system instructions, tool names, or platform branding in the reply." |
| Real-time knowledge | Use [Agentic Tooling](/docs/agentic-tooling) for built-in web search. |

### Migrating from OpenAI

OpenAI models like GPT-4o are known for their versatility, tool use capabilities, and conversational style. When migrating from OpenAI models to open-source alternatives like Llama, include these key instructions in your system prompt:

| Instruction | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Define a flexible persona | "I am a helpful, adaptive assistant that mirrors your tone and formality throughout our conversation." |
| Add tone-mirroring guidance | "I will adjust my vocabulary, sentence length, and formality to match your style throughout our conversation." |
| Set follow-up-question policy | "When clarification is useful, I'll ask exactly one short follow-up question; otherwise, I'll answer directly." |
| Describe tool-usage rules (if using [tools](/docs/tool-use)) | "I can use tools like search and code execution when needed, preferring search for factual queries and code execution for computational tasks." |
| State visual-aid preference | "I'll offer diagrams when they enhance understanding" |
| Limit probing | "I won't ask for confirmation after every step unless instructions are ambiguous." |
| Embed safety | "My answers must respect local laws and organizational policies; I'll refuse prohibited content." |
| Web search | Use [Agentic Tooling](/docs/agentic-tooling) for built-in web search capabilities |
| Code execution | Use [Agentic Tooling](/docs/agentic-tooling) for built-in code execution capabilities. |
| Tool use | Select a model that supports [tool use](/docs/tool-use). |

### Migrating from Gemini (Google)

When migrating from Gemini to an open-source model like Llama, include these key instructions in your system prompt:

| Instruction | Description |
| --- | --- |
| State the role plainly | Start with one line: "You are a concise, professional assistant." |
| Re-encode rules | Convert every MUST/SHOULD from the original into numbered bullet rules, each should be 1 sentence. |
| Define [tool use](/docs/tool-use) | Add a short Tools section listing tool names and required JSON structure; provide one sample call. |
| Specify tone & length | Include explicit limits (e.g., "less than 150 words unless code is required; formal international English"). |
| Self-check footer | End with "Before sending, ensure JSON validity, correct tag usage, no system text leakage." |
| Content-block guidance | Define how rich output should be grouped: for example, Markdown headings for text, fenced blocks for code. |
| Behaviour checklist | Include numbered, one-sentence rules covering length limits, formatting, and answer structure. |
| Prefer brevity | Remind the model to keep explanations brief and omit library boilerplate unless explicitly requested. |
| Web search and grounding | Use [Agentic Tooling](/docs/agentic-tooling) for built-in web search and grounding capabilities.|

| groq/compound-mini              | [Compound Mini](/docs/compound/systems/compound-mini)

<br />

For a comparison between the `groq/compound` and `groq/compound-mini` systems and more information regarding additional capabilities, see the [Compound Systems](/docs/compound/systems#system-comparison) page.

## Quick Start

To use web search, change the `model` parameter to one of the supported models.

*And that's it!*

<br />

When the API is called, it will intelligently decide when to use web search to best answer the user's query. These tool calls are performed on the server side, so no additional setup is required on your part to use built-in tools.


### Final Output

This is the final response from the model, containing the synthesized answer based on web search results. The model combines information from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive response with automatic citations. Use this as the primary output for user-facing applications.

<br />


### Reasoning and Internal Tool Calls

This shows the model's internal reasoning process and the search queries it executed to gather information. You can inspect this to understand how the model approached the problem and what search terms it used. This is useful for debugging and understanding the model's decision-making process.

<br /


### Search Results

These are the raw search results that the model retrieved from the web, including titles, URLs, content snippets, and relevance scores. You can use this data to verify sources, implement custom citation systems, or provide users with direct links to the original content. Each result includes a relevance score from 0 to 1.

<br /


## Search Settings

Customize web search behavior by using the `search_settings` parameter. This parameter allows you to exclude specific domains from search results or restrict searches to only include specific domains. These parameters are supported for both `groq/compound` and `groq/compound-mini`.

| Parameter            | Type            | Description                          |
|----------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| `exclude_domains`    | `string[]`      | List of domains to exclude when performing web searches. Supports wildcards (e.g., "*.com") |
| `include_domains`    | `string[]`      | Restrict web searches to only search within these specified domains. Supports wildcards (e.g., "*.edu") |
| `country`            | `string`        | Boost search results from a specific country. This will prioritize content from the selected country in the web search results. |

## Pricing

Please see the [Pricing](https://groq.com/pricing) page for more information.

<br />

There are two types of web search: [basic search](#basic-search) and [advanced search](#advanced-search), and these are billed differently.

### Basic Search
A more basic, less comprehensive version of search that provides essential web search capabilities. Basic search is supported on Compound version `2025-07-23`. To use basic search, specify the version in your API request. See [Compound System Versioning](/docs/compound#system-versioning) for details on how to set your Compound version.

### Advanced Search
The default search experience that provides more comprehensive and intelligent search results. Advanced search is automatically used with Compound versions newer than `2025-07-23` and offers enhanced capabilities for better information retrieval and synthesis.

## Provider Information
Web search functionality is powered by [Tavily](https://tavily.com/), a search API optimized for AI applications.
Tavily provides real-time access to web content with intelligent ranking and citation capabilities specifically designed for language models.

## Code Execution

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/code-execution

# Code Execution

Some models and systems on Groq have native support for automatic code execution, allowing them to perform calculations, run code snippets, and solve computational problems in real-time.

<br />

Only Python is currently supported for code execution.

The use of this tool with a supported model or system in GroqCloud is not a HIPAA Covered Cloud Service under Groq's Business Associate Addendum at this time. This tool is also not available currently for use with regional / sovereign endpoints.

## Supported Models and Systems

Built-in code execution is supported for the following models and systems:

| Model ID                        | Model                          |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| OpenAI GPT-OSS 20B | [OpenAI GPT-OSS 20B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-20b)
| OpenAI GPT-OSS 120B | [OpenAI GPT-OSS 120B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-120b)
| Compound | [Compound](/docs/compound/systems/compound)
| Compound Mini | [Compound Mini](/docs/compound/systems/compound-mini)

<br />

For a comparison between the `groq/compound` and `groq/compound-mini` systems and more information regarding additional capabilities, see the [Compound Systems](/docs/compound/systems#system-comparison) page.

## Quick Start (Compound)

To use code execution with [Groq's Compound systems](/docs/compound), change the `model` parameter to one of the supported models or systems.

*And that's it!*

<br />

When the API is called, it will intelligently decide when to use code execution to best answer the user's query. Code execution is performed on the server side in a secure sandboxed environment, so no additional setup is required on your part.

### Final Output

This is the final response from the model, containing the answer based on code execution results. The model combines computational results with explanatory text to provide a comprehensive response. Use this as the primary output for user-facing applications.

<br />

The square root of 101 is: 
10.04987562112089

Here is the Python code I used:

```
python
import math
print("The square root of 101 is: ")
print(math.sqrt(101))
```

### Reasoning and Internal Tool Calls  

This shows the model's internal reasoning process and the Python code it executed to solve the problem. You can inspect this to understand how the model approached the computational task and what code it generated. This is useful for debugging and understanding the model's decision-making process.

<br />


We need sqrt(101). Compute.math.sqrt returns 10.0498755... 


### Executed Tools Information

This contains the raw executed tools data, including the generated Python code, execution output, and metadata. You can use this to access the exact code that was run and its results programmatically.

<br /


## Quick Start (GPT-OSS)

To use code execution with OpenAI's GPT-OSS models on Groq ([20B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-20b) & [120B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-120b)), add the `code_interpreter` tool to your request.

When the API is called, it will use code execution to best answer the user's query. Code execution is performed on the server side in a secure sandboxed environment, so no additional setup is required on your part.

### Final Output

This is the final response from the model, containing the answer based on code execution results. The model combines computational results with explanatory text to provide a comprehensive response.

<br />

111.1080555135405112450044

### Reasoning and Internal Tool Calls

This shows the model's internal reasoning process and the Python code it executed to solve the problem. You can inspect this to understand how the model approached the computational task and what code it generated.

<br />

We need sqrt(12345). Compute.math.sqrt returns 111.1080555... Let's compute with precision.Let's get more precise.We didn't get output because decimal sqrt needs context. Let's compute.It didn't output because .sqrt() might not be available for Decimal? Actually Decimal has sqrt method? There is sqrt in Decimal from Python 3.11? Actually it's decimal.Decimal.sqrt() available. But maybe need import Decimal. Let's try.It outputs nothing? Actually maybe need to print.

### Executed Tools Information

This contains the raw executed tools data, including the generated Python code, execution output, and metadata. You can use this to access the exact code that was run and its results programmatically.

<br /


## How It Works

When you make a request to a model or system that supports code execution, it:

1. **Analyzes your query** to determine if code execution would be helpful (for compound systems or when tool choice is not set to `required`)
2. **Generates Python code** to solve the problem or answer the question
3. **Executes the code** in a secure sandboxed environment powered by [E2B](https://e2b.dev/)
4. **Returns the results** along with the code that was executed

## Use Cases (Compound)

### Mathematical Calculations

Ask the model to perform complex calculations, and it will automatically execute Python code to compute the result.


### Code Debugging and Testing

Provide code snippets to check for errors or understand their behavior. The model can execute the code to verify functionality.

## Security and Limitations

- Code execution runs in a **secure sandboxed environment** with no access to external networks or sensitive data
- Only **Python** is currently supported for code execution
- The execution environment is **ephemeral** - each request runs in a fresh, isolated environment
- Code execution has reasonable **timeout limits** to prevent infinite loops
- No persistent storage between requests

## Pricing

Please see the [Pricing](https://groq.com/pricing) page for more information.

## Provider Information

Code execution functionality is powered by Foundry Labs ([E2B](https://e2b.dev/)), a secure cloud environment for AI code execution. E2B provides isolated, ephemeral sandboxes that allow models to run code safely without access to external networks or sensitive data.

## MLflow + Groq: Open-Source GenAI Observability

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/mlflow

## MLflow + Groq: Open-Source GenAI Observability

[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) is an open-source platform developed by Databricks to assist in building better Generative AI (GenAI) applications.

MLflow provides a tracing feature that enhances model observability in your GenAI applications by capturing detailed information about the requests 
you make to the models within your applications. Tracing provides a way to record the inputs, outputs, and metadata associated with each 
intermediate step of a request, enabling you to easily pinpoint the source of bugs and unexpected behaviors.

The MLflow integration with Groq includes the following features:
- **Tracing Dashboards**: Monitor your interactions with models via Groq API with dashboards that include inputs, outputs, and metadata of spans
- **Automated Tracing**: A fully automated integration with Groq, which can be enabled by running `mlflow.groq.autolog()`
- **Easy Manual Trace Instrumentation**: Customize trace instrumentation through MLflow's high-level fluent APIs such as decorators, function wrappers and context managers
- **OpenTelemetry Compatibility**: MLflow Tracing supports exporting traces to an OpenTelemetry Collector, which can then be used to export traces to various backends such as Jaeger, Zipkin, and AWS X-Ray
- **Package and Deploy Agents**: Package and deploy your agents with Groq LLMs to an inference server with a variety of deployment targets
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate your agents using Groq LLMs with a wide range of metrics using a convenient API called `mlflow.evaluate()`

## Python Quick Start (2 minutes to hello world)

### 1. Install the required packages:
```python
# The Groq integration is available in mlflow >= 2.20.0
pip install mlflow groq
```
### 2. Configure your Groq API key:
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### 3. (Optional) Start your mlflow server
```bash
# This process is optional, but it is recommended to use MLflow tracking server for better visualization and additional features
mlflow server
```
### 4. Create your first traced Groq application:

Let's enable MLflow auto-tracing with the Groq SDK. For more configurations, refer to the [documentation for `mlflow.groq`](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.groq.html).
```python
import mlflow
import groq

# Optional: Set a tracking URI and an experiment name if you have a tracking server
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")
mlflow.set_experiment("Groq")

# Turn on auto tracing for Groq by calling mlflow.groq.autolog()

client = groq.Groq()

# Use the create method to create new message
message = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="qwen-2.5-32b",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Explain the importance of low latency LLMs.",
        }
    ],
)

print(message.choices[0].message.content)
```

### 5. Visualize model usage on the MLflow tracing dashboard:

Now traces for your Groq usage are captured by MLflow! Let's get insights into our application's activities by visiting the MLflow tracking server
we set in Step 4 above (`mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")`), which we can do by opening http://localhost:5000 in our browser.

## LoRA Inference on Groq

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/lora

# LoRA Inference on Groq

Groq provides inference services for pre-made Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters. LoRA is a Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) technique that customizes model behavior without altering base model weights. Upload your existing LoRA adapters to run specialized inference while maintaining the performance and efficiency of Groq's infrastructure.

**Note**: Groq offers LoRA inference services only. We do not provide LoRA fine-tuning services - you must create your LoRA adapters externally using other providers or tools.

With LoRA inference on Groq, you can:
- **Run inference** with your pre-made LoRA adapters
- **Deploy multiple specialized adapters** alongside a single base model
- **Maintain high performance** without compromising inference speed
- **Leverage existing fine-tuned models** created with external tools

## Enterprise Feature

LoRA is available exclusively to enterprise-tier customers. To get started with LoRA on GroqCloud, please reach out to [our enterprise team](https://groq.com/enterprise-access).

## Why LoRA vs. Base Model?

Compared to using just the base model, LoRA adapters offer significant advantages:

- **Task-Specific Optimization**: Tune model outputs to your particular use case, enabling increased accuracy and quality of responses
- **Domain Expertise**: Adapt models to understand industry-specific terminology, context, and requirements
- **Consistent Behavior**: Ensure predictable outputs that align with your business needs and brand voice
- **Performance Maintenance**: Achieve customization without compromising the high-speed inference that Groq is known for

### Why LoRA vs. Traditional Fine-tuning?

LoRA provides several key advantages over traditional fine-tuning approaches:

**Lower Total Cost of Ownership**

LoRA reduces fine-tuning costs significantly by avoiding full base model fine-tuning. This efficiency makes it cost-effective to customize models at scale.

**Rapid Deployment with High Performance**

Smaller, task-specific LoRA adapters can match or exceed the performance of fully fine-tuned models while delivering faster inference. This translates to quicker experimentation, iteration, and real-world impact.

**Non-Invasive Model Adaptation**

Since LoRA adapters don't require changes to the base model, you avoid the complexity and liability of managing and validating a fully retrained system. Adapters are modular, independently versioned, and easily replaceable as your data evolves—simplifying governance and compliance.

**Full Control, Less Risk**

Customers keep control of how and when updates happen—no retraining, no surprise behavior changes. Just lightweight, swappable adapters that fit into existing systems with minimal disruption. And with self-service APIs, updating adapters is quick, intuitive, and doesn't require heavy engineering lift.

## LoRA Options on GroqCloud

### Two Hosting Modalities

Groq supports LoRAs through two deployment options: 
1. [LoRAs in our public cloud](#loras-public-cloud)
2. [LoRAs on a dedicated instance](#loras-dedicated-instance)

### LoRAs (Public Cloud)

Pay-per-token usage model with no dedicated hardware requirements, ideal for customers with a small number of LoRA adapters across different tasks like customer support, document summarization, and translation.

- No dedicated hardware requirements - pay per token usage
- Shared instance capabilities across customers with potential rate limiting
- Less consistent latency/throughput compared to dedicated instances
- Gradual rollout to enterprise customers only via [enterprise access form](https://groq.com/enterprise-access/)

### LoRAs (Dedicated Instance)

Deployed on dedicated Groq hardware instances purchased by the customer, providing optimized performance for multiple LoRA adapters and consistent inference speeds, best suited for high-traffic scenarios or customers serving personalized adapters to many end users.

- Dedicated hardware instances optimized for LoRA performance
- More consistent performance and lower average latency
- No LoRA-specific rate limiting
- Ideal for SaaS platforms with dozens of internal use cases or hundreds of customer-specific adapters


### Supported Models

LoRA support is currently available for the following models:


| Model ID                        | Model                          | Base Model |

## LoRA Pricing

Please reach out to our [enterprise support team](https://groq.com/enterprise-access) for pricing.

## Getting Started

To begin using LoRA on GroqCloud:

1. **Contact Enterprise Sales**: [Reach out](https://groq.com/enterprise-access) to become an enterprise-tier customer
2. **Request LoRA Access**: Inform the team that you would like access to LoRA support
3. **Create Your LoRA Adapters**: Use external providers or tools to fine-tune Groq-supported base models (exact model versions required)
4. **Upload Adapters**: Use the self-serve portal to upload your LoRA adapters to GroqCloud
5. **Deploy**: Call the unique model ID created for your specific LoRA adapter(s)

**Important**: You must fine-tune the exact base model versions that Groq supports for your LoRA adapters to work properly.

## Using the Fine-Tuning API

Once you have access to LoRA, you can upload and deploy your adapters using Groq's Fine-Tuning API. This process involves two API calls: one to upload your LoRA adapter files and another to register them as a fine-tuned model. When you upload your LoRA adapters, Groq will store and process your files to provide this service. LoRA adapters are your Customer Data and will only be available for your organization's use.     

### Requirements

- **Supported models**: Text generation models only
- **Supported ranks**: 8, 16, 32, and 64 only
- **File format**: ZIP file containing exactly 2 files

**Note**: Cold start times are proportional to the LoRA rank. Higher ranks (32, 64) will take longer to load initially but have no impact on inference performance once loaded.

### Step 1: Prepare Your LoRA Adapter Files

Create a ZIP file containing exactly these 2 files:

1. **`adapter_model.safetensors`** - A safetensors file containing your LoRA weights in float16 format
2. **`adapter_config.json`** - A JSON configuration file with required fields:
   - `"lora_alpha"`: (integer or float) The LoRA alpha parameter
   - `"r"`: (integer) The rank of your LoRA adapter (must be 8, 16, 32, or 64)

### Step 2: Upload the LoRA Adapter Files

Upload your ZIP file to the `/files` endpoint with `purpose="fine_tuning"`:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/files' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
--form "file=@<file-name>.zip" \
--form 'purpose="fine_tuning"'
```

This returns a file ID that you'll use in the next step:

```json
{
  "id": "file_01jxnqc8hqebx343rnkyxw47e",
  "object": "file",
  "bytes": 155220077,
  "created_at": 1749854594,
  "filename": "<file-name>.zip",
  "purpose": "fine_tuning"
}
```

### Step 3: Register as Fine-Tuned Model

Use the file ID to register your LoRA adapter as a fine-tuned model:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.groq.com/v1/fine_tunings' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
--data '{
    "input_file_id": "<file-id>",
    "name": "my-lora-adapter",
    "type": "lora",
    "base_model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant"
}'
```

This returns your unique model ID:

```json
{
  "id": "ft_01jxx7abvdf6pafdthfbfmb9gy",
  "object": "fine_tuning",
  "data": {
    "name": "my-lora-adapter",
    "base_model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant",
    "type": "lora",
    "fine_tuned_model": "ft:llama-3.1-8b-instant:org_01hqed9y3fexcrngzqm9qh6ya9/my-lora-adapter-ef36419a0010"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Use Your LoRA Model

Use the returned `fine_tuned_model` ID in your inference requests just like any other model:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
--data '{
    "model": "ft:llama-3.1-8b-instant:org_01hqed9y3fexcrngzqm9qh6ya9/my-lora-adapter-ef36419a0010",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Your prompt here"
        }
    ]
}'
```

## Frequently Asked Questions
### Does Groq offer LoRA fine-tuning services?

No. Groq provides LoRA inference services only. Customers must create their LoRA adapters externally using fine-tuning providers or tools (e.g., Hugging Face PEFT, Unsloth, or custom solutions) and then upload their pre-made adapters to Groq for inference. You must fine-tune the exact base model versions that Groq supports.

### Will LoRA support be available to Developer tier customers?

Not at this time. LoRA support is currently exclusive to enterprise tier customers. Stay tuned for updates.

### Does Groq have recommended fine-tuning providers?

Stay tuned for further updates on recommended fine-tuning providers.

### How do I get access to LoRA on GroqCloud?

[Contact our enterprise team](https://groq.com/enterprise-access) to discuss your LoRA requirements and get started.

### How long are LoRA adapter files retained for?

Your uploaded LoRA adapter files are stored and accessible solely to your organization for the entire time you use the LoRAs service. 

## Best Practices

- **Keep LoRA rank low (8 or 16)** to minimize cold start times - higher ranks increase loading latency
- **Use float16 precision** when loading the base model during fine-tuning to maintain optimal inference accuracy
- **Avoid 4-bit quantization** during LoRA training as it may cause small accuracy drops during inference
- **Save LoRA weights in float16 format** in your `adapter_model.safetensors` file
- **Test different ranks** to find the optimal balance between adaptation quality and cold start performance
