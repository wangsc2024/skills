  "content": "vLLM is a Python library that supports the following CPU variants. Select your CPU type to see vendor specific instructions:\n\nvLLM supports basic model inferencing and serving on x86 CPU platform, with data types FP32, FP16 and BF16.\n\nvLLM offers basic model inferencing and serving on Arm CPU platform, with support NEON, data types FP32, FP16 and BF16.\n\nvLLM has experimental support for macOS with Apple Silicon. For now, users must build from source to natively run on macOS.\n\nCurrently the CPU implementation for macOS supports FP32 and FP16 datatypes.\n\nGPU-Accelerated Inference with vLLM-Metal\n\nFor GPU-accelerated inference on Apple Silicon using Metal, check out vllm-metal, a community-maintained hardware plugin that uses MLX as the compute backend.\n\nvLLM has experimental support for s390x architecture on IBM Z platform. For now, users must build from source to natively run on IBM Z platform.\n\nCurrently, the CPU implementation for s390x architecture supports FP32 datatype only.\n\nThe main discussions happen in the #sig-cpu channel of vLLM Slack.\n\nWhen open a Github issue about the CPU backend, please add [CPU Backend] in the title and it will be labeled with cpu for better awareness.\n\nUse lscpu to check the CPU flags.\n\nIt's recommended to use uv, a very fast Python environment manager, to create and manage Python environments. Please follow the documentation to install uv. After installing uv, you can create a new Python environment using the following commands:\n\nWhen specifying the index URL, please make sure to use the cpu variant subdirectory. For example, the nightly build index is: https://wheels.vllm.ai/nightly/cpu/.\n\nPre-built vLLM wheels for x86 with AVX512 are available since version 0.13.0. To install release wheels:\n\nBefore use vLLM CPU installed via wheels, make sure TCMalloc and Intel OpenMP are installed and added to LD_PRELOAD:\n\nInstall the latest code\n\nTo install the wheel built from the latest main branch:\n\nInstall specific revisions\n\nIf you want to access the wheels for previous commits (e.g. to bisect the behavior change, performance regression), you can specify the commit hash in the URL:\n\nPre-built vLLM wheels for Arm are available since version 0.11.2. These wheels contain pre-compiled C++ binaries.\n\nBefore use vLLM CPU installed via wheels, make sure TCMalloc is installed and added to LD_PRELOAD:\n\nThe uv approach works for vLLM v0.6.6 and later. A unique feature of uv is that packages in --extra-index-url have higher priority than the default index. If the latest public release is v0.6.6.post1, uv's behavior allows installing a commit before v0.6.6.post1 by specifying the --extra-index-url. In contrast, pip combines packages from --extra-index-url and the default index, choosing only the latest version, which makes it difficult to install a development version prior to the released version.\n\nInstall the latest code\n\nLLM inference is a fast-evolving field, and the latest code may contain bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features that are not released yet. To allow users to try the latest code without waiting for the next release, vLLM provides working pre-built Arm CPU wheels for every commit since v0.11.2 on https://wheels.vllm.ai/nightly. For native CPU wheels, this index should be used:\n\nTo install from nightly index, run:\n\nUsing pip to install from nightly indices is not supported, because pip combines packages from --extra-index-url and the default index, choosing only the latest version, which makes it difficult to install a development version prior to the released version. In contrast, uv gives the extra index higher priority than the default index.\n\nIf you insist on using pip, you have to specify the full URL (link address) of the wheel file (which can be obtained from https://wheels.vllm.ai/nightly/cpu/vllm).\n\nInstall specific revisions\n\nIf you want to access the wheels for previous commits (e.g. to bisect the behavior change, performance regression), you can specify the commit hash in the URL:\n\nCurrently, there are no pre-built Apple silicon CPU wheels.\n\nCurrently, there are no pre-built IBM Z CPU wheels.\n\nPlease refer to the instructions for Python-only build on GPU, and replace the build commands with:\n\nInstall recommended compiler. We recommend to use gcc/g++ >= 12.3.0 as the default compiler to avoid potential problems. For example, on Ubuntu 22.4, you can run:\n\nIt's recommended to use uv, a very fast Python environment manager, to create and manage Python environments. Please follow the documentation to install uv. After installing uv, you can create a new Python environment using the following commands:\n\nClone the vLLM project:\n\nInstall the required dependencies:\n\nBuild and install vLLM:\n\nIf you want to develop vLLM, install it in editable mode instead.\n\nOptionally, build a portable wheel which you can then install elsewhere:\n\nBefore use vLLM CPU installed via wheels, make sure TCMalloc and Intel OpenMP are installed and added to LD_PRELOAD:\n\nFirst, install the recommended compiler. We recommend using gcc/g++ >= 12.3.0 as the default compiler to avoid potential problems. For example, on Ubuntu 22.4, you can run:\n\nSecond, clone the vLLM project:\n\nThird, install required dependencies:\n\nFinally, build and install vLLM:\n\nIf you want to develop vLLM, install it in editable mode instead.\n\nTesting has been conducted on AWS Graviton3 instances for compatibility.\n\nBefore use vLLM CPU installed via wheels, make sure TCMalloc is installed and added to LD_PRELOAD:\n\nAfter installation of XCode and the Command Line Tools, which include Apple Clang, execute the following commands to build and install vLLM from source.\n\nThe --index-strategy unsafe-best-match flag is needed to resolve dependencies across multiple package indexes (PyTorch CPU index and PyPI). Without this flag, you may encounter typing-extensions version conflicts.\n\nThe term \"unsafe\" refers to the package resolution strategy, not security. By default, uv only searches the first index where a package is found to prevent dependency confusion attacks. This flag allows uv to search all configured indexes to find the best compatible versions. Since both PyTorch and PyPI are trusted package sources, using this strategy is safe and appropriate for vLLM installation.\n\nOn macOS the VLLM_TARGET_DEVICE is automatically set to cpu, which is currently the only supported device.\n\nIf the build fails with errors like the following where standard C++ headers cannot be found, try to remove and reinstall your Command Line Tools for Xcode.\n\nIf the build fails with C++11/C++17 compatibility errors like the following, the issue is that the build system is defaulting to an older C++ standard:\n\nSolution: Your compiler might be using an older C++ standard. Edit cmake/cpu_extension.cmake and add set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17) before set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON).\n\nTo check your compiler's C++ standard support:\n\nInstall the following packages from the package manager before building the vLLM. For example on RHEL 9.4:\n\nInstall rust>=1.80 which is needed for outlines-core and uvloop python packages installation.\n\nExecute the following commands to build and install vLLM from source.\n\nPlease build the following dependencies, torchvision, pyarrow from source before building vLLM.\n\nhttps://gallery.ecr.aws/q9t5s3a7/vllm-cpu-release-repo\n\nIf deploying the pre-built images on machines without avx512f, avx512_bf16, or avx512_vnni support, an Illegal instruction error may be raised. It is recommended to build images for these machines with the appropriate build arguments (e.g., --build-arg VLLM_CPU_DISABLE_AVX512=true, --build-arg VLLM_CPU_AVX512BF16=false, or --build-arg VLLM_CPU_AVX512VNNI=false) to disable unsupported features. Please note that without avx512f, AVX2 will be used and this version is not recommended because it only has basic feature support.\n\nSee Using Docker for instructions on using the official Docker image.\n\nStable vLLM Docker images are being pre-built for Arm from version 0.12.0. Available image tags are here: https://gallery.ecr.aws/q9t5s3a7/vllm-arm64-cpu-release-repo.\n\nYou can also access the latest code with Docker images. These are not intended for production use and are meant for CI and testing only. They will expire after several days.\n\nThe latest code can contain bugs and may not be stable. Please use it with caution.\n\nCurrently, there are no pre-built Arm silicon CPU images.\n\nCurrently, there are no pre-built IBM Z CPU images.\n\nAn alternative of --privileged=true is --cap-add SYS_NICE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined.\n\nAn alternative of --privileged=true is --cap-add SYS_NICE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined.\n\nAn alternative of --privileged true is --cap-add SYS_NICE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined.\n\nor using default auto thread binding:\n\nNote, it is recommended to manually reserve 1 CPU for vLLM front-end process when world_size == 1.\n\nFor the full and up-to-date list of models validated on CPU platforms, please see the official documentation: Supported Models on CPU\n\nFor any model listed under Supported Models on CPU, optimized runtime configurations are provided in the vLLM Benchmark Suite’s CPU test cases, defined in cpu test cases For details on how these optimized configurations are determined, see: performance-benchmark-details. To benchmark the supported models using these optimized settings, follow the steps in running vLLM Benchmark Suite manually and run the Benchmark Suite on a CPU environment.\n\nBelow is an example command to benchmark all CPU-supported models using optimized configurations.\n\nThe benchmark results will be saved in ./benchmark/results/. In the directory, the generated .commands files contain all example commands for the benchmark.\n\nWe recommend configuring tensor-parallel-size to match the number of NUMA nodes on your system. Note that the current release does not support tensor-parallel-size=6. To determine the number of NUMA nodes available, use the following command:\n\nFor performance reference, users may also consult the vLLM Performance Dashboard , which publishes default-model CPU results produced using the same Benchmark Suite.\n\nDefault auto thread-binding is recommended for most cases. Ideally, each OpenMP thread will be bound to a dedicated physical core respectively, threads of each rank will be bound to the same NUMA node respectively, and 1 CPU per rank will be reserved for other vLLM components when world_size > 1. If you have any performance problems or unexpected binding behaviours, please try to bind threads as following.\n\nOn a hyper-threading enabled platform with 16 logical CPU cores / 8 physical CPU cores:\n\nThis value is 4GB by default. Larger space can support more concurrent requests, longer context length. However, users should take care of memory capacity of each NUMA node. The memory usage of each TP rank is the sum of weight shard size and VLLM_CPU_KVCACHE_SPACE, if it exceeds the capacity of a single NUMA node, the TP worker will be killed with exitcode 9 due to out-of-memory.\n\nFirst of all, please make sure the thread-binding and KV cache space are properly set and take effect. You can check the thread-binding by running a vLLM benchmark and observing CPU cores usage via htop.\n\nUse multiples of 32 as --block-size, which is 128 by default.\n\nInference batch size is an important parameter for the performance. A larger batch usually provides higher throughput, a smaller batch provides lower latency. Tuning the max batch size starting from the default value to balance throughput and latency is an effective way to improve vLLM CPU performance on specific platforms. There are two important related parameters in vLLM:\n\nvLLM CPU supports data parallel (DP), tensor parallel (TP) and pipeline parallel (PP) to leverage multiple CPU sockets and memory nodes. For more details of tuning DP, TP and PP, please refer to Optimization and Tuning. For vLLM CPU, it is recommended to use DP, TP and PP together if there are enough CPU sockets and memory nodes.\n\nIn some container environments (like Docker), NUMA-related syscalls used by vLLM (e.g., get_mempolicy, migrate_pages) are blocked/denied in the runtime's default seccomp/capabilities settings. This may lead to warnings like get_mempolicy: Operation not permitted. Functionality is not affected, but NUMA memory binding/migration optimizations may not take effect and performance can be suboptimal.\n\nTo enable these optimizations inside Docker with the least privilege, you can follow below tips:\n\nAlternatively, running with --privileged=true also works but is broader and not generally recommended.\n\nIn K8S, the following configuration can be added to workload yaml to achieve the same effect as above:",
