  "content": "vLLM supports generative and pooling models across various tasks.\n\nFor each task, we list the model architectures that have been implemented in vLLM. Alongside each architecture, we include some popular models that use it.\n\nIf vLLM natively supports a model, its implementation can be found in vllm/model_executor/models.\n\nThese models are what we list in supported text models and supported multimodal models.\n\nvLLM also supports model implementations that are available in Transformers. You should expect the performance of a Transformers model implementation used in vLLM to be within <5% of the performance of a dedicated vLLM model implementation. We call this feature the \"Transformers modeling backend\".\n\nCurrently, the Transformers modeling backend works for the following:\n\n*Vision-language models currently accept only image inputs. Support for video inputs will be added in a future release.\n\nIf the Transformers model implementation follows all the steps in writing a custom model then, when used with the Transformers modeling backend, it will be compatible with the following features of vLLM:\n\nChecking if the modeling backend is Transformers is as simple as:\n\nIf the printed type starts with Transformers... then it's using the Transformers model implementation!\n\nIf a model has a vLLM implementation but you would prefer to use the Transformers implementation via the Transformers modeling backend, set model_impl=\"transformers\" for offline inference or --model-impl transformers for the online serving.\n\nFor vision-language models, if you are loading with dtype=\"auto\", vLLM loads the whole model with config's dtype if it exists. In contrast the native Transformers will respect the dtype attribute of each backbone in the model. That might cause a slight difference in performance.\n\nIf a model is neither supported natively by vLLM nor Transformers, it can still be used in vLLM!\n\nFor a model to be compatible with the Transformers modeling backend for vLLM it must:\n\nIf the compatible model is:\n\nThis means that, with the Transformers modeling backend for vLLM, new models can be used before they are officially supported in Transformers or vLLM!\n\nThis section details the necessary modifications to make to a Transformers compatible custom model that make it compatible with the Transformers modeling backend for vLLM. (We assume that a Transformers compatible custom model has already been created, see Transformers - Customizing models).\n\nTo make your model compatible with the Transformers modeling backend, it needs:\n\nHere is what happens in the background when this model is loaded:\n\nFor your model to be compatible with vLLM's tensor parallel and/or pipeline parallel features, you must add base_model_tp_plan and/or base_model_pp_plan to your model's config class:\n\nBy default, vLLM loads models from Hugging Face (HF) Hub. To change the download path for models, you can set the HF_HOME environment variable; for more details, refer to their official documentation.\n\nTo determine whether a given model is natively supported, you can check the config.json file inside the HF repository. If the \"architectures\" field contains a model architecture listed below, then it should be natively supported.\n\nModels do not need to be natively supported to be used in vLLM. The Transformers modeling backend enables you to run models directly using their Transformers implementation (or even remote code on the Hugging Face Model Hub!).\n\nThe easiest way to check if your model is really supported at runtime is to run the program below:\n\nIf vLLM successfully returns text (for generative models) or hidden states (for pooling models), it indicates that your model is supported.\n\nOtherwise, please refer to Adding a New Model for instructions on how to implement your model in vLLM. Alternatively, you can open an issue on GitHub to request vLLM support.\n\nIf you prefer, you can use the Hugging Face CLI to download a model or specific files from a model repository:\n\nUse the Hugging Face CLI to manage models stored in local cache:\n\nUse the Hugging Face CLI to interactively delete downloaded model from the cache:\n\nHere are some tips for loading/downloading models from Hugging Face using a proxy:\n\nTo use models from ModelScope instead of Hugging Face Hub, set an environment variable:\n\nAnd use with trust_remote_code=True.\n\n✅︎ indicates that the feature is supported for the model.\n\n🚧 indicates that the feature is planned but not yet supported for the model.\n\n⚠️ indicates that the feature is available but may have known issues or limitations.\n\nSee this page for more information on how to use generative models.\n\nThese models primarily accept the LLM.generate API. Chat/Instruct models additionally support the LLM.chat API.\n\nSome models are supported only via the Transformers modeling backend. The purpose of the table below is to acknowledge models which we officially support in this way. The logs will say that the Transformers modeling backend is being used, and you will see no warning that this is fallback behaviour. This means that, if you have issues with any of the models listed below, please make an issue and we'll do our best to fix it!\n\nCurrently, the ROCm version of vLLM supports Mistral and Mixtral only for context lengths up to 4096.\n\nSee this page for more information on how to use pooling models.\n\nSince some model architectures support both generative and pooling tasks, you should explicitly specify --runner pooling to ensure that the model is used in pooling mode instead of generative mode.\n\nThese models primarily support the LLM.embed API.\n\nC Automatically converted into an embedding model via --convert embed. (details) * Feature support is the same as that of the original model.\n\nssmits/Qwen2-7B-Instruct-embed-base has an improperly defined Sentence Transformers config. You need to manually set mean pooling by passing --pooler-config '{\"pooling_type\": \"MEAN\"}'.\n\nFor Alibaba-NLP/gte-Qwen2-*, you need to enable --trust-remote-code for the correct tokenizer to be loaded. See relevant issue on HF Transformers.\n\njinaai/jina-embeddings-v3 supports multiple tasks through LoRA, while vllm temporarily only supports text-matching tasks by merging LoRA weights.\n\nThe second-generation GTE model (mGTE-TRM) is named NewModel. The name NewModel is too generic, you should set --hf-overrides '{\"architectures\": [\"GteNewModel\"]}' to specify the use of the GteNewModel architecture.\n\nIf your model is not in the above list, we will try to automatically convert the model using as_embedding_model. By default, the embeddings of the whole prompt are extracted from the normalized hidden state corresponding to the last token.\n\nThese models primarily support the LLM.classify API.\n\nC Automatically converted into a classification model via --convert classify. (details) * Feature support is the same as that of the original model.\n\nIf your model is not in the above list, we will try to automatically convert the model using as_seq_cls_model. By default, the class probabilities are extracted from the softmaxed hidden state corresponding to the last token.\n\nCross-encoder and reranker models are a subset of classification models that accept two prompts as input. These models primarily support the LLM.score API.\n\nC Automatically converted into a classification model via --convert classify. (details) * Feature support is the same as that of the original model.\n\nLoad the official original BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-gemma by using the following command.\n\nThe second-generation GTE model (mGTE-TRM) is named NewForSequenceClassification. The name NewForSequenceClassification is too generic, you should set --hf-overrides '{\"architectures\": [\"GteNewForSequenceClassification\"]}' to specify the use of the GteNewForSequenceClassification architecture.\n\nnvidia/llama-nemotron-rerank-1b-v2 require a specific prompt format to work correctly.\n\nExamples : offline_using_template.py online_using_template.py\n\nLoad the official original mxbai-rerank-v2 by using the following command.\n\nLoad the official original Qwen3 Reranker by using the following command. More information can be found at: examples/pooling/score/offline_reranker.py.\n\nThese models primarily support the LLM.reward API.\n\nFor process-supervised reward models such as peiyi9979/math-shepherd-mistral-7b-prm, the pooling config should be set explicitly, e.g.: --pooler-config '{\"pooling_type\": \"STEP\", \"step_tag_id\": 123, \"returned_token_ids\": [456, 789]}'.\n\nThese models primarily support the LLM.encode API.\n\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) usage, please refer to examples/pooling/token_classify/ner.py, examples/pooling/token_classify/ner_client.py.\n\nThe following modalities are supported depending on the model:\n\nAny combination of modalities joined by + are supported.\n\nOn the other hand, modalities separated by / are mutually exclusive.\n\nSee this page on how to pass multi-modal inputs to the model.\n\nFor hybrid-only models such as Llama-4, Step3 and Mistral-3, a text-only mode can be enabled by setting all supported multimodal modalities to 0 (e.g, --limit-mm-per-prompt '{\"image\":0}) so that their multimodal modules will not be loaded to free up more GPU memory for KV cache.\n\nvLLM currently only supports dynamic LoRA adapters on the language backbone of multimodal models. If you wish to use a model with LoRA in the multi-modal encoder, please merge the weights into the base model first before running it in vLLM like a regular model.\n\nSee this page for more information on how to use generative models.\n\nThese models primarily accept the LLM.generate API. Chat/Instruct models additionally support the LLM.chat API.\n\nSome models are supported only via the Transformers modeling backend. The purpose of the table below is to acknowledge models which we officially support in this way. The logs will say that the Transformers modeling backend is being used, and you will see no warning that this is fallback behaviour. This means that, if you have issues with any of the models listed below, please make an issue and we'll do our best to fix it!\n\n^ You need to set the architecture name via --hf-overrides to match the one in vLLM. • For example, to use DeepSeek-VL2 series models: --hf-overrides '{\"architectures\": [\"DeepseekVLV2ForCausalLM\"]}' E Pre-computed embeddings can be inputted for this modality. + Multiple items can be inputted per text prompt for this modality.\n\nGemma3nForConditionalGeneration is only supported on V1 due to shared KV caching and it depends on timm>=1.0.17 to make use of its MobileNet-v5 vision backbone.\n\nPerformance is not yet fully optimized mainly due to:\n\nFor InternVLChatModel, only InternVL2.5 with Qwen2.5 text backbone (OpenGVLab/InternVL2.5-1B etc.), InternVL3 and InternVL3.5 have video inputs support currently.\n\nTo use TIGER-Lab/Mantis-8B-siglip-llama3, you have to pass --hf_overrides '{\"architectures\": [\"MantisForConditionalGeneration\"]}' when running vLLM.\n\nThe official openbmb/MiniCPM-V-2 doesn't work yet, so we need to use a fork (HwwwH/MiniCPM-V-2) for now. For more details, please see: Pull Request #4087\n\nFor Qwen2.5-Omni and Qwen3-Omni, reading audio from video pre-processing (--mm-processor-kwargs '{\"use_audio_in_video\": true}') is currently work in progress and not yet supported.\n\nSpeech2Text models trained specifically for Automatic Speech Recognition.\n\nVoxtralForConditionalGeneration requires mistral-common[audio] to be installed.\n\nSee this page for more information on how to use pooling models.\n\nThese models primarily support the LLM.embed API.\n\nTo get the best results, you should use pooling models that are specifically trained as such.\n\nThe following table lists those that are tested in vLLM.\n\nC Automatically converted into an embedding model via --convert embed. (details) * Feature support is the same as that of the original model.\n\nCross-encoder and reranker models are a subset of classification models that accept two prompts as input. These models primarily support the LLM.score API.\n\nC Automatically converted into a classification model via --convert classify. (details) * Feature support is the same as that of the original model.\n\nAt vLLM, we are committed to facilitating the integration and support of third-party models within our ecosystem. Our approach is designed to balance the need for robustness and the practical limitations of supporting a wide range of models. Here’s how we manage third-party model support:\n\nCommunity-Driven Support: We encourage community contributions for adding new models. When a user requests support for a new model, we welcome pull requests (PRs) from the community. These contributions are evaluated primarily on the sensibility of the output they generate, rather than strict consistency with existing implementations such as those in transformers. Call for contribution: PRs coming directly from model vendors are greatly appreciated!\n\nBest-Effort Consistency: While we aim to maintain a level of consistency between the models implemented in vLLM and other frameworks like transformers, complete alignment is not always feasible. Factors like acceleration techniques and the use of low-precision computations can introduce discrepancies. Our commitment is to ensure that the implemented models are functional and produce sensible results.\n\nWhen comparing the output of model.generate from Hugging Face Transformers with the output of llm.generate from vLLM, note that the former reads the model's generation config file (i.e., generation_config.json) and applies the default parameters for generation, while the latter only uses the parameters passed to the function. Ensure all sampling parameters are identical when comparing outputs.\n\nIssue Resolution and Model Updates: Users are encouraged to report any bugs or issues they encounter with third-party models. Proposed fixes should be submitted via PRs, with a clear explanation of the problem and the rationale behind the proposed solution. If a fix for one model impacts another, we rely on the community to highlight and address these cross-model dependencies. Note: for bugfix PRs, it is good etiquette to inform the original author to seek their feedback.\n\nMonitoring and Updates: Users interested in specific models should monitor the commit history for those models (e.g., by tracking changes in the main/vllm/model_executor/models directory). This proactive approach helps users stay informed about updates and changes that may affect the models they use.\n\nSelective Focus: Our resources are primarily directed towards models with significant user interest and impact. Models that are less frequently used may receive less attention, and we rely on the community to play a more active role in their upkeep and improvement.\n\nThrough this approach, vLLM fosters a collaborative environment where both the core development team and the broader community contribute to the robustness and diversity of the third-party models supported in our ecosystem.\n\nNote that, as an inference engine, vLLM does not introduce new models. Therefore, all models supported by vLLM are third-party models in this regard.\n\nWe have the following levels of testing for models:",
