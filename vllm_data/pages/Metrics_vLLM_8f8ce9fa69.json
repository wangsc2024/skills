  "content": "vLLM exposes a rich set of metrics to support observability and capacity planning for the V1 engine.\n\nMetrics in vLLM can be categorized as follows:\n\nThe mental model is that server-level metrics help explain the values of request-level metrics.\n\nIn v1, an extensive set of metrics are exposed via a Prometheus-compatible /metrics endpoint using the vllm: prefix, for example:\n\nThese are documented under Inferencing and Serving -> Production Metrics.\n\nvLLM also provides a reference example for how to collect and store these metrics using Prometheus and visualize them using a Grafana dashboard.\n\nThe subset of metrics exposed in the Grafana dashboard gives us an indication of which metrics are especially important:\n\nSee the PR which added this Dashboard for interesting and useful background on the choices made here.\n\nPrometheus support was initially added using the aioprometheus library, but a switch was made quickly to prometheus_client. The rationale is discussed in both linked PRs.\n\nDuring those migrations we briefly lost a MetricsMiddleware to track HTTP metrics, but this was reinstated using prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator:\n\nHistorically, metrics were collected in the engine core process and multiprocess mode was used to make them available in the API server process. See Pull Request #7279.\n\nMore recently, metrics are collected in the API server process and multiprocess mode is only used when --api-server-count > 1. See Pull Request #17546 and details on API server scale-out.\n\nThe following metrics are supported by default by prometheus_client, but they are not exposed when multiprocess mode is used:\n\nTherefore, these metrics are unavailable when --api-server-count > 1. It's questionable how relevant these are since they do not aggregate these stats for all processes that make up a vLLM instance.\n\nThe \"Even Better Observability\" feature where was where much of the metrics design was planned. For example, see where a detailed roadmap was laid out.\n\nTo help understand the background to the metrics design, here are some of the relevant PRs which added the original, now legacy, metrics:\n\nFor background, here are the relevant PRs relating to the metrics implementation Issue #10582:\n\nIn v1, we wish to move computation and overhead out of the engine core process to minimize the time between each forward pass.\n\nThe overall idea of V1 EngineCore design is:\n\nWe will achieve this by collecting metrics in the frontend API server, and base these metrics on information we can glean from the EngineCoreOutputs returned by the engine core process to the frontend.\n\nMany of our metrics are the time interval between various events in the processing of a request. It is best practice to use timestamps based on \"monotonic time\" (time.monotonic()) rather than \"wall-clock time\" (time.time()) to calculate intervals as the former is unaffected by system clock changes (e.g. from NTP).\n\nIt's also important to note that monotonic clocks differ between processes - each process has its own reference point. So it is meaningless to compare monotonic timestamps from different processes.\n\nTherefore, in order to calculate an interval, we must compare two monotonic timestamps from the same process.\n\nThe engine core process will collect some key statistics from the scheduler - e.g. the number of requests that were scheduled or waiting after the last scheduler pass - and include those statistics in EngineCoreOutputs.\n\nThe engine core will also record the timestamp of certain per-request events so that the frontend can calculate the interval between these events.\n\nAnd the calculated intervals are:\n\nWe explored the possibility of having the frontend calculate these intervals using the timing of events visible by the frontend. However, the frontend does not have visibility into the timing of the QUEUED and SCHEDULED events and, since we need to calculate intervals based on monotonic timestamps from the same process ... we need the engine core to record timestamps for all of these events.\n\nWhen a preemption occurs during decode, since any already generated tokens are reused, we consider the preemption as affecting the inter-token, decode, and inference intervals.\n\nWhen a preemption occurs during prefill (assuming such an event is possible), we consider the preemption as affecting the time-to-first-token and prefill intervals.\n\nAs the frontend processes a single EngineCoreOutputs - i.e. the output from a single engine core iteration - it collects various statistics relating to that iteration:\n\nFor any requests that were completed in a given iteration, we also record:\n\nWe also emit a set of histograms that describe how long sampled KV cache blocks stay resident and how often they are reused. Sampling (--kv-cache-metrics-sample) keeps the overhead tiny; when a block is chosen we record:\n\nThose map directly to the Prometheus metrics:\n\nThe engine core only ships raw eviction events via SchedulerStats; the frontend drains them, turns them into Prometheus observations, and also exposes the same data through LLM.get_metrics() when logging is on. Looking at lifetime and idle time on one chart makes it easy to spot stranded cache or workloads that pin prompts for a long decode.\n\nThe LoggingStatLogger metrics publisher outputs a log INFO message every 5 seconds with some key metrics:\n\nThe PrometheusStatLogger metrics publisher makes the metrics available via a /metrics HTTP endpoint in a Prometheus-compatible format. A Prometheus instance can then be configured to poll this endpoint (e.g. every second) and record the values in its time-series database. Prometheus is often used via Grafana, allowing these metrics to be graphed over time.\n\nPrometheus supports the following metric types:\n\nPrometheus metrics can also be labelled, allowing metrics to be combined according to matching labels. In vLLM, we add a model_name label to every metric which includes the name of the model served by that instance.\n\nThe choice of histogram buckets to be most useful to users across a broad set of use cases is not straightforward and will require refinement over time.\n\nprometheus_client has support for Info metrics which are equivalent to a Gauge whose value is permanently set to 1, but exposes interesting key/value pair information via labels. This is used for information about an instance that does not change - so it only needs to be observed at startup - and allows comparing across instances in Prometheus.\n\nWe use this concept for the vllm:cache_config_info metric:\n\nHowever, prometheus_client has never supported Info metrics in multiprocessing mode - for unclear reasons. We simply use a Gauge metric set to 1 and multiprocess_mode=\"mostrecent\" instead.\n\nThe vllm:lora_requests_info Gauge is somewhat similar, except the value is the current wall-clock time, and is updated every iteration.\n\nThe label names used are:\n\nEncoding a running/waiting counts for multiple adapters in a comma-separated string seems quite misguided - we could use labels to distinguish between per-adapter counts. This should be revisited.\n\nNote that multiprocess_mode=\"livemostrecent\" is used - the most recent metric is used, but only from currently running processes.\n\nThis was added in Pull Request #9477 and there is at least one known user. If we revisit this design and deprecate the old metric, we should coordinate with downstream users so they can migrate before the removal.\n\nThe discussion in Issue #10582 about adding prefix cache metrics yielded some interesting points which may be relevant to how we approach future metrics.\n\nEvery time the prefix cache is queried, we record the number of tokens queried and the number of queried tokens present in the cache (i.e. hits).\n\nHowever, the metric of interest is the hit rate - i.e. the number of hits per query.\n\nIn the case of logging, we expect the user is best served by calculating the hit rate over a fixed number of the most recent queries (the interval is fixed to 1k most recent queries for now).\n\nIn the case of Prometheus though, we should take advantage of the time-series nature of Prometheus and allow the user to calculate the hit rate over an interval of their choosing. For example, a PromQL query to calculate the hit interval of the past 5 minutes:\n\nTo achieve this, we should record the queries and hits as counters in Prometheus, rather than recording the hit rate as a gauge.\n\nDeprecating metrics shouldn't be taken lightly. Users may not notice a metric has been deprecated, and may be quite inconvenienced when it is suddenly (from their perspective) when it is removed, even if there is an equivalent metric for them to use.\n\nAs an example, see how vllm:avg_prompt_throughput_toks_per_s was deprecated (with a comment in the code), removed, and then noticed by a user.\n\nSee the deprecation policy for the project-wide deprecation policy.\n\nAdded by Pull Request #4464, but apparently never implemented. This can just be removed.\n\nThe vllm:time_in_queue_requests Histogram metric was added by Pull Request #9659 and its calculation is:\n\nTwo weeks later, Pull Request #4464 added vllm:request_queue_time_seconds leaving us with:\n\nThis seems duplicative, and one of them should be removed. The latter is used by the Grafana dashboard, so we should deprecate or remove the former.\n\nSee above - we now expose 'queries' and 'hits' counters rather than a 'hit rate' gauge.\n\nTwo legacy metrics relate to a \"swapped\" preemption mode that is no longer relevant in v1:\n\nIn this mode, when a request is preempted (e.g. to make room in KV cache to complete other requests), we swap kv cache blocks out to CPU memory. This is also known as \"KV cache offloading\" and is configured with --swap-space and --preemption-mode.\n\nHistorically, vLLM has long supported beam search. The SequenceGroup encapsulated the idea of N Sequences which all shared the same prompt kv blocks. This enabled KV cache block sharing between requests, and copy-on-write to do branching. CPU swapping was intended for these beam search like cases.\n\nLater, the concept of prefix caching was introduced, which allowed KV cache blocks to be shared implicitly. This proved to be a better option than CPU swapping since blocks can be evicted slowly on demand and the part of the prompt that was evicted can be recomputed.\n\nSequenceGroup was removed in V1, although a replacement will be required for \"parallel sampling\" (n>1). Beam search was moved out of the core. There was a lot of complex code for a very uncommon feature.\n\nIn V1, with prefix caching being better (zero over head) and therefore on by default, the preemption and recompute strategy should work better.\n\nSome legacy metrics are only relevant in the context of \"parallel sampling\". This is where the n parameter in a request is used to request multiple completions from the same prompt.\n\nAs part of adding parallel sampling support in Pull Request #10980, we should also add these metrics.\n\nObserves the value of the 'n' parameter of every finished request.\n\nObserves the maximum output length of all sequences in every finished sequence group. In the absence of parallel sampling, this is equivalent to vllm:request_generation_tokens.\n\nSome legacy metrics are specific to \"speculative decoding\". This is where we generate candidate tokens using a faster, approximate method or model and then validate those tokens with the larger model.\n\nThere is a PR under review ( Pull Request #12193) to add \"prompt lookup (ngram)\" speculative decoding to v1. Other techniques will follow. We should revisit these metrics in this context.\n\nWe should probably expose acceptance rate as separate accepted and draft counters, like we do for prefix caching hit rate. Efficiency likely also needs similar treatment.\n\nA common use case for our metrics is to support automated scaling of vLLM instances.\n\nFor related discussion from the Kubernetes Serving Working Group, see:\n\nThis is a non-trivial topic. Consider this comment from Rob:\n\nI think this metric should focus on trying to estimate what the max concurrency that will cause the average request length > queries per second ... since this is really what will \"saturate\" the server.\n\nA clear goal is that we should expose the metrics required to detect this saturation point, so administrators can implement auto-scaling rules based on those. However, in order to do so, we need to have a clear view on how an administrator (and automated monitoring system) should judge an instance as approaching saturation:\n\nTo identify, what is the saturation point for model server compute (the inflection point where we cannot get more throughput with a higher request rate, but start to incur additional latency) so we can autoscale effectively?\n\nOur approach to naming metrics probably deserves to be revisited:\n\nSome of our metric names end with _total:\n\nIf there is a suffix of _total on the metric name, it will be removed. When exposing the time series for counter, a _total suffix will be added. This is for compatibility between OpenMetrics and the Prometheus text format, as OpenMetrics requires the _total suffix.\n\nThere is no shortage of ideas for new metrics:\n\nWe should be cautious in our approach to adding new metrics. While metrics are often relatively straightforward to add:\n\nMetrics provide an aggregated view over time of the system's performance and health. Tracing, on the other hand, tracks individual requests as they move through different services and components. Both fall under the more general heading of \"Observability\".\n\nvLLM has support for OpenTelemetry tracing:\n\nOpenTelemetry has a Gen AI Working Group.\n\nSince metrics is a big enough topic on its own, we consider the topic of tracing to be quite separate from metrics.\n\nThe current implementation exposes the following two metrics:\n\nThese metrics are only enabled when OpenTelemetry tracing is enabled and if --collect-detailed-traces=all/model/worker is used. The documentation for this option states:\n\ncollect detailed traces for the specified modules. This involves use of possibly costly and or blocking operations and hence might have a performance impact.\n\nThe metrics were added by Pull Request #7089 and who up in an OpenTelemetry trace as:\n\nWe already have inference_time and decode_time metrics, so the question is whether there are sufficiently common use cases for the higher-resolution timings to justify the overhead.\n\nSince we are going to treat the question of OpenTelemetry support separately, we will include these particular metrics under that topic.",

Time Metrics¶ vLLM exposes a rich set of metrics to support observability and capacity planning for the V1 engine. Objectives¶ Provide comprehensive coverage of engine and request level metrics to aid production monitoring. Prioritize Prometheus integrations, as this is what we expect to be used in production environments. Offer logging support (i.e. printing metrics to the info log) for ad-hoc testing, debugging, development, and exploratory use cases. Background¶ Metrics in vLLM can be categorized as follows: Server-level metrics: Global metrics that track the state and performance of the LLM engine. These are typically exposed as Gauges or Counters in Prometheus. Request-level metrics: Metrics that track the characteristics (e.g. size and timing) of individual requests. These are typically exposed as Histograms in Prometheus and are often the SLOs that an SRE monitoring vLLM will be tracking. The mental model is that server-level metrics help explain the values of request-level metrics. Metrics Overview¶ v1 Metrics¶ In v1, an extensive set of metrics are exposed via a Prometheus-compatible /metrics endpoint using the vllm: prefix, for example: vllm:num_requests_running (Gauge) - Number of requests currently running. vllm:kv_cache_usage_perc (Gauge) - Fraction of used KV cache blocks (0–1). vllm:prefix_cache_queries (Counter) - Number of prefix cache queries. vllm:prefix_cache_hits (Counter) - Number of prefix cache hits. vllm:prompt_tokens_total (Counter) - Total number of prompt tokens processed. vllm:generation_tokens_total (Counter) - Total number of generated tokens. vllm:request_success_total (Counter) - Number of finished requests (by finish reason). vllm:request_prompt_tokens (Histogram) - Histogram of input prompt token counts. vllm:request_generation_tokens (Histogram) - Histogram of generation token counts. vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds (Histogram) - Time to first token (TTFT). vllm:inter_token_latency_seconds (Histogram) - Inter-token latency. vllm:e2e_request_latency_seconds (Histogram) - End-to-end request latency. vllm:request_prefill_time_seconds (Histogram) - Request prefill time. vllm:request_decode_time_seconds (Histogram) - Request decode time. These are documented under Inferencing and Serving -> Production Metrics. Grafana Dashboard¶ vLLM also provides a reference example for how to collect and store these metrics using Prometheus and visualize them using a Grafana dashboard. The subset of metrics exposed in the Grafana dashboard gives us an indication of which metrics are especially important: vllm:e2e_request_latency_seconds_bucket - End to end request latency measured in seconds. vllm:prompt_tokens - Prompt tokens. vllm:generation_tokens - Generation tokens. vllm:time_per_output_token_seconds - Inter-token latency (Time Per Output Token, TPOT) in seconds. vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds - Time to First Token (TTFT) latency in seconds. vllm:num_requests_running (also, _swapped and _waiting) - Number of requests in the RUNNING, WAITING, and SWAPPED states. vllm:kv_cache_usage_perc - Percentage of used cache blocks by vLLM. vllm:request_prompt_tokens - Request prompt length. vllm:request_generation_tokens - Request generation length. vllm:request_success - Number of finished requests by their finish reason: either an EOS token was generated or the max sequence length was reached. vllm:request_queue_time_seconds - Queue time. vllm:request_prefill_time_seconds - Requests prefill time. vllm:request_decode_time_seconds - Requests decode time. vllm:request_max_num_generation_tokens - Max generation tokens in a sequence group. See the PR which added this Dashboard for interesting and useful background on the choices made here. Prometheus Client Library¶ Prometheus support was initially added using the aioprometheus library, but a switch was made quickly to prometheus_client. The rationale is discussed in both linked PRs. During those migrations we briefly lost a MetricsMiddleware to track HTTP metrics, but this was reinstated using prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator: $ curl http://0.0.0.0:8000/metrics 2>/dev/null | grep -P '^http_(?!.*(_bucket|_created|_sum)).*' http_requests_total{handler=\"/v1/completions\",method=\"POST\",status=\"2xx\"} 201.0 http_request_size_bytes_count{handler=\"/v1/completions\"} 201.0 http_response_size_bytes_count{handler=\"/v1/completions\"} 201.0 http_request_duration_highr_seconds_count 201.0 http_request_duration_seconds_count{handler=\"/v1/completions\",method=\"POST\"} 201.0 Multi-process Mode¶ Historically, metrics were collected in the engine core process and multiprocess mode was used to make them available in the API server process. See Pull Request #7279. More recently, metrics are collected in the API server process and multiprocess mode is only used when --api-server-count > 1. See Pull Request #17546 and details on API server scale-out. Built in Python/Process Metrics¶ The following metrics are supported by default by prometheus_client, but they are not exposed when multiprocess mode is used: python_gc_objects_collected_total python_gc_objects_uncollectable_total python_gc_collections_total python_info process_virtual_memory_bytes process_resident_memory_bytes process_start_time_seconds process_cpu_seconds_total process_open_fds process_max_fds Therefore, these metrics are unavailable when --api-server-count > 1. It's questionable how relevant these are since they do not aggregate these stats for all processes that make up a vLLM instance. Metrics Design¶ The \"Even Better Observability\" feature where was where much of the metrics design was planned. For example, see where a detailed roadmap was laid out. Legacy PRs¶ To help understand the background to the metrics design, here are some of the relevant PRs which added the original, now legacy, metrics: Pull Request #1890 Pull Request #2316 Pull Request #2730 Pull Request #4464 Pull Request #7279 Metrics Implementation PRs¶ For background, here are the relevant PRs relating to the metrics implementation Issue #10582: Pull Request #11962 Pull Request #11973 Pull Request #10907 Pull Request #12416 Pull Request #12478 Pull Request #12516 Pull Request #12530 Pull Request #12561 Pull Request #12579 Pull Request #12592 Pull Request #12644 Metrics Collection¶ In v1, we wish to move computation and overhead out of the engine core process to minimize the time between each forward pass. The overall idea of V1 EngineCore design is: EngineCore is the inner loop. Performance is most critical here AsyncLLM is the outer loop. This is overlapped with GPU execution (ideally), so this is where any \"overheads\" should be if possible. So AsyncLLM.output_handler_loop is the ideal place for the metrics bookkeeping if possible. We will achieve this by collecting metrics in the frontend API server, and base these metrics on information we can glean from the EngineCoreOutputs returned by the engine core process to the frontend. Interval Calculations¶ Many of our metrics are the time interval between various events in the processing of a request. It is best practice to use timestamps based on \"monotonic time\" (time.monotonic()) rather than \"wall-clock time\" (time.time()) to calculate intervals as the former is unaffected by system clock changes (e.g. from NTP). It's also important to note that monotonic clocks differ between processes - each process has its own reference point. So it is meaningless to compare monotonic timestamps from different processes. Therefore, in order to calculate an interval, we must compare two monotonic timestamps from the same process. Scheduler Stats¶ The engine core process will collect some key statistics from the scheduler - e.g. the number of requests that were scheduled or waiting after the last scheduler pass - and include those statistics in EngineCoreOutputs. Engine Core Events¶ The engine core will also record the timestamp of certain per-request events so that the frontend can calculate the interval between these events. The events are: QUEUED - when the request was received by the engine core and added to the scheduler queue. SCHEDULED - when the request was first scheduled for execution. PREEMPTED - the request has been put back in the waiting queue in order to make room for other requests to complete. It will be re-scheduled in future and re-start its prefill phase. NEW_TOKENS - when the output included in EngineCoreOutput was generated. Since this is common to all requests in a given iteration, we use a single timestamp on EngineCoreOutputs to record this event. And the calculated intervals are: Queue interval - between QUEUED and most recent SCHEDULED. Prefill interval - between most recent SCHEDULED and the subsequent first NEW_TOKENS. Decode interval - between first (after the most recent SCHEDULED) and last NEW_TOKENS. Inference interval - between most recent SCHEDULED and last NEW_TOKENS. Inter-token interval - between successive NEW_TOKENS. Put another way: We explored the possibility of having the frontend calculate these intervals using the timing of events visible by the frontend. However, the frontend does not have visibility into the timing of the QUEUED and SCHEDULED events and, since we need to calculate intervals based on monotonic timestamps from the same process ... we need the engine core to record timestamps for all of these events. Interval Calculations vs Preemptions¶ When a preemption occurs during decode, since any already generated tokens are reused, we consider the preemption as affecting the inter-token, decode, and inference intervals. When a preemption occurs during prefill (assuming such an event is possible), we consider the preemption as affecting the time-to-first-token and prefill intervals. Frontend Stats Collection¶ As the frontend processes a single EngineCoreOutputs - i.e. the output from a single engine core iteration - it collects various statistics relating to that iteration: The total number of new tokens generated in this iteration. The total number of prompt tokens processed by the prefills that completed in this iteration. The queue intervals for any requests that were scheduled in this iteration. The prefill intervals for any requests that completed prefill in this iteration. The inter-token intervals (Time Per Output Token, TPOT), for all requests included in this iteration. The Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) for any requests that completed prefill in this iteration. However, we calculate this interval relative to when the request was first received by the frontend (arrival_time) in order to account for input processing time. For any requests that were completed in a given iteration, we also record: The inference and decode intervals - relative to the scheduled and first token events, as described above. End-to-end latency - the interval between frontend arrival_time and the frontend receiving the final token. KV Cache Residency Metrics¶ We also emit a set of histograms that describe how long sampled KV cache blocks stay resident and how often they are reused. Sampling (--kv-cache-metrics-sample) keeps the overhead tiny; when a block is chosen we record: lifetime – allocation ⟶ eviction idle before eviction – last touch ⟶ eviction reuse gaps – the pauses between touches when the block gets reused Those map directly to the Prometheus metrics: vllm:kv_block_lifetime_seconds – how long each sampled block exists. vllm:kv_block_idle_before_evict_seconds – idle tail after the final access. vllm:kv_block_reuse_gap_seconds – time between consecutive touches. The engine core only ships raw eviction events via SchedulerStats; the frontend drains them, turns them into Prometheus observations, and also exposes the same data through LLM.get_metrics() when logging is on. Looking at lifetime and idle time on one chart makes it easy to spot stranded cache or workloads that pin prompts for a long decode. Metrics Publishing - Logging¶ The LoggingStatLogger metrics publisher outputs a log INFO message every 5 seconds with some key metrics: The current number of running/waiting requests The current GPU cache usage The number of prompt tokens processed per second over the past 5 seconds The number of new tokens generated per second over the past 5 seconds The prefix cache hit rate over the most recent 1k kv-cache block queries Metrics Publishing - Prometheus¶ The PrometheusStatLogger metrics publisher makes the metrics available via a /metrics HTTP endpoint in a Prometheus-compatible format. A Prometheus instance can then be configured to poll this endpoint (e.g. every second) and record the values in its time-series database. Prometheus is often used via Grafana, allowing these metrics to be graphed over time. Prometheus supports the following metric types: Counter: a value that will increase over time, never reducing, and generally reset to zero when the vLLM instance restarts. For example, the number of tokens generated over the lifetime of the instance. Gauge: a value that goes up and down, for example the number of requests currently scheduled for execution. Histogram: a count of metric samples, recorded in buckets. For example, the number of requests whose TTFT was <1ms, <5ms, <10ms, <20ms, and so on. Prometheus metrics can also be labelled, allowing metrics to be combined according to matching labels. In vLLM, we add a model_name label to every metric which includes the name of the model served by that instance. Example output: $ curl http://0.0.0.0:8000/metrics # HELP vllm:num_requests_running Number of requests in model execution batches. # TYPE vllm:num_requests_running gauge vllm:num_requests_running{model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 8.0 ... # HELP vllm:generation_tokens_total Number of generation tokens processed. # TYPE vllm:generation_tokens_total counter vllm:generation_tokens_total{model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 27453.0 ... # HELP vllm:request_success_total Count of successfully processed requests. # TYPE vllm:request_success_total counter vllm:request_success_total{finished_reason=\"stop\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 1.0 vllm:request_success_total{finished_reason=\"length\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 131.0 vllm:request_success_total{finished_reason=\"abort\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 0.0 ... # HELP vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds Histogram of time to first token in seconds. # TYPE vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds histogram vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds_bucket{le=\"0.001\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 0.0 vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds_bucket{le=\"0.005\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 0.0 vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds_bucket{le=\"0.01\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 0.0 vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds_bucket{le=\"0.02\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 13.0 vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds_bucket{le=\"0.04\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 97.0 vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds_bucket{le=\"0.06\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 123.0 vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds_bucket{le=\"0.08\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 138.0 vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds_bucket{le=\"0.1\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 140.0 vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds_count{model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 140.0 Note The choice of histogram buckets to be most useful to users across a broad set of use cases is not straightforward and will require refinement over time. Cache Config Info¶ prometheus_client has support for Info metrics which are equivalent to a Gauge whose value is permanently set to 1, but exposes interesting key/value pair information via labels. This is used for information about an instance that does not change - so it only needs to be observed at startup - and allows comparing across instances in Prometheus. We use this concept for the vllm:cache_config_info metric: # HELP vllm:cache_config_info Information of the LLMEngine CacheConfig # TYPE vllm:cache_config_info gauge vllm:cache_config_info{block_size=\"16\",cache_dtype=\"auto\",calculate_kv_scales=\"False\",cpu_offload_gb=\"0\",enable_prefix_caching=\"False\",gpu_memory_utilization=\"0.9\",...} 1.0 However, prometheus_client has never supported Info metrics in multiprocessing mode - for unclear reasons. We simply use a Gauge metric set to 1 and multiprocess_mode=\"mostrecent\" instead. LoRA Metrics¶ The vllm:lora_requests_info Gauge is somewhat similar, except the value is the current wall-clock time, and is updated every iteration. The label names used are: running_lora_adapters: a per-adapter count of the number requests running using that adapter, formatted as a comma-separated string. waiting_lora_adapters: similar, except counting requests that are waiting to be scheduled. max_lora - the static \"max number of LoRAs in a single batch.\" configuration. Encoding a running/waiting counts for multiple adapters in a comma-separated string seems quite misguided - we could use labels to distinguish between per-adapter counts. This should be revisited. Note that multiprocess_mode=\"livemostrecent\" is used - the most recent metric is used, but only from currently running processes. This was added in Pull Request #9477 and there is at least one known user. If we revisit this design and deprecate the old metric, we should coordinate with downstream users so they can migrate before the removal. Prefix Cache metrics¶ The discussion in Issue #10582 about adding prefix cache metrics yielded some interesting points which may be relevant to how we approach future metrics. Every time the prefix cache is queried, we record the number of tokens queried and the number of queried tokens present in the cache (i.e. hits). However, the metric of interest is the hit rate - i.e. the number of hits per query. In the case of logging, we expect the user is best served by calculating the hit rate over a fixed number of the most recent queries (the interval is fixed to 1k most recent queries for now). In the case of Prometheus though, we should take advantage of the time-series nature of Prometheus and allow the user to calculate the hit rate over an interval of their choosing. For example, a PromQL query to calculate the hit interval of the past 5 minutes: rate(cache_query_hit[5m]) / rate(cache_query_total[5m]) To achieve this, we should record the queries and hits as counters in Prometheus, rather than recording the hit rate as a gauge. Deprecated Metrics¶ How To Deprecate¶ Deprecating metrics shouldn't be taken lightly. Users may not notice a metric has been deprecated, and may be quite inconvenienced when it is suddenly (from their perspective) when it is removed, even if there is an equivalent metric for them to use. As an example, see how vllm:avg_prompt_throughput_toks_per_s was deprecated (with a comment in the code), removed, and then noticed by a user. In general: We should be cautious about deprecating metrics, especially since it can be hard to predict the user impact. We should include a prominent deprecation notice in the help string that is included in the `/metrics' output. We should list deprecated metrics in user-facing documentation and release notes. We should consider hiding deprecated metrics behind a CLI argument in order to give administrators an escape hatch for some time before deleting them. See the deprecation policy for the project-wide deprecation policy. Unimplemented - vllm:tokens_total¶ Added by Pull Request #4464, but apparently never implemented. This can just be removed. Duplicated - Queue Time¶ The vllm:time_in_queue_requests Histogram metric was added by Pull Request #9659 and its calculation is: self.metrics.first_scheduled_time = now self.metrics.time_in_queue = now - self.metrics.arrival_time Two weeks later, Pull Request #4464 added vllm:request_queue_time_seconds leaving us with: if seq_group.is_finished(): if (seq_group.metrics.first_scheduled_time is not None and seq_group.metrics.first_token_time is not None): time_queue_requests.append( seq_group.metrics.first_scheduled_time - seq_group.metrics.arrival_time) ... if seq_group.metrics.time_in_queue is not None: time_in_queue_requests.append( seq_group.metrics.time_in_queue) This seems duplicative, and one of them should be removed. The latter is used by the Grafana dashboard, so we should deprecate or remove the former. Prefix Cache Hit Rate¶ See above - we now expose 'queries' and 'hits' counters rather than a 'hit rate' gauge. KV Cache Offloading¶ Two legacy metrics relate to a \"swapped\" preemption mode that is no longer relevant in v1: vllm:num_requests_swapped vllm:cpu_cache_usage_perc In this mode, when a request is preempted (e.g. to make room in KV cache to complete other requests), we swap kv cache blocks out to CPU memory. This is also known as \"KV cache offloading\" and is configured with --swap-space and --preemption-mode. Historically, vLLM has long supported beam search. The SequenceGroup encapsulated the idea of N Sequences which all shared the same prompt kv blocks. This enabled KV cache block sharing between requests, and copy-on-write to do branching. CPU swapping was intended for these beam search like cases. Later, the concept of prefix caching was introduced, which allowed KV cache blocks to be shared implicitly. This proved to be a better option than CPU swapping since blocks can be evicted slowly on demand and the part of the prompt that was evicted can be recomputed. SequenceGroup was removed in V1, although a replacement will be required for \"parallel sampling\" (n>1). Beam search was moved out of the core. There was a lot of complex code for a very uncommon feature. In V1, with prefix caching being better (zero over head) and therefore on by default, the preemption and recompute strategy should work better. Future Work¶ Parallel Sampling¶ Some legacy metrics are only relevant in the context of \"parallel sampling\". This is where the n parameter in a request is used to request multiple completions from the same prompt. As part of adding parallel sampling support in Pull Request #10980, we should also add these metrics. vllm:request_params_n (Histogram) Observes the value of the 'n' parameter of every finished request. vllm:request_max_num_generation_tokens (Histogram) Observes the maximum output length of all sequences in every finished sequence group. In the absence of parallel sampling, this is equivalent to vllm:request_generation_tokens. Speculative Decoding¶ Some legacy metrics are specific to \"speculative decoding\". This is where we generate candidate tokens using a faster, approximate method or model and then validate those tokens with the larger model. vllm:spec_decode_draft_acceptance_rate (Gauge) vllm:spec_decode_efficiency (Gauge) vllm:spec_decode_num_accepted_tokens (Counter) vllm:spec_decode_num_draft_tokens (Counter) vllm:spec_decode_num_emitted_tokens (Counter) There is a PR under review ( Pull Request #12193) to add \"prompt lookup (ngram)\" speculative decoding to v1. Other techniques will follow. We should revisit these metrics in this context. Note We should probably expose acceptance rate as separate accepted and draft counters, like we do for prefix caching hit rate. Efficiency likely also needs similar treatment. Autoscaling and Load-balancing¶ A common use case for our metrics is to support automated scaling of vLLM instances. For related discussion from the Kubernetes Serving Working Group, see: Standardizing Large Model Server Metrics in Kubernetes Benchmarking LLM Workloads for Performance Evaluation and Autoscaling in Kubernetes Inference Perf Issue #5041 and Pull Request #12726. This is a non-trivial topic. Consider this comment from Rob: I think this metric should focus on trying to estimate what the max concurrency that will cause the average request length > queries per second ... since this is really what will \"saturate\" the server. A clear goal is that we should expose the metrics required to detect this saturation point, so administrators can implement auto-scaling rules based on those. However, in order to do so, we need to have a clear view on how an administrator (and automated monitoring system) should judge an instance as approaching saturation: To identify, what is the saturation point for model server compute (the inflection point where we cannot get more throughput with a higher request rate, but start to incur additional latency) so we can autoscale effectively? Metric Naming¶ Our approach to naming metrics probably deserves to be revisited: The use of colons in metric names seems contrary to \"colons are reserved for user defined recording rules\". Most of our metrics follow the convention of ending with units, but not all do. Some of our metric names end with _total: If there is a suffix of _total on the metric name, it will be removed. When exposing the time series for counter, a _total suffix will be added. This is for compatibility between OpenMetrics and the Prometheus text format, as OpenMetrics requires the _total suffix. Adding More Metrics¶ There is no shortage of ideas for new metrics: Examples from other projects like TGI Proposals arising from specific use cases, like the Kubernetes auto-scaling topic above Proposals that might arise out of standardisation efforts like OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for Gen AI. We should be cautious in our approach to adding new metrics. While metrics are often relatively straightforward to add: They can be difficult to remove - see the section on deprecation above. They can have a meaningful performance impact when enabled. And metrics are usually of very limited use unless they can be enabled by default and in production. They have an impact on development and maintenance of the project. Every metric added over time has made this effort more time-consuming, and perhaps not all metrics justify this ongoing investment in their maintenance. Tracing - OpenTelemetry¶ Metrics provide an aggregated view over time of the system's performance and health. Tracing, on the other hand, tracks individual requests as they move through different services and components. Both fall under the more general heading of \"Observability\". vLLM has support for OpenTelemetry tracing: Added by Pull Request #4687 and reinstated by Pull Request #20372 Configured with --oltp-traces-endpoint and --collect-detailed-traces OpenTelemetry blog post User-facing docs Blog post IBM product docs OpenTelemetry has a Gen AI Working Group. Since metrics is a big enough topic on its own, we consider the topic of tracing to be quite separate from metrics. OpenTelemetry Model Forward vs Execute Time¶ The current implementation exposes the following two metrics: vllm:model_forward_time_milliseconds (Histogram) - The time spent in the model forward pass when this request was in the batch. vllm:model_execute_time_milliseconds (Histogram) - The time spent in the model execute function. This will include model forward, block/sync across workers, cpu-gpu sync time and sampling time. These metrics are only enabled when OpenTelemetry tracing is enabled and if --collect-detailed-traces=all/model/worker is used. The documentation for this option states: collect detailed traces for the specified modules. This involves use of possibly costly and or blocking operations and hence might have a performance impact. The metrics were added by Pull Request #7089 and who up in an OpenTelemetry trace as: -> gen_ai.latency.time_in_scheduler: Double(0.017550230026245117) -> gen_ai.latency.time_in_model_forward: Double(3.151565277099609) -> gen_ai.latency.time_in_model_execute: Double(3.6468167304992676) We already have inference_time and decode_time metrics, so the question is whether there are sufficiently common use cases for the higher-resolution timings to justify the overhead. Since we are going to treat the question of OpenTelemetry support separately, we will include these particular metrics under that topic. December 10, 2025",

      "description": "Metrics¶ vLLM exposes a rich set of metrics to support observability and capacity planning for the V1 engine. Objectives¶ Provide comprehensive coverage of engine and request level metrics to aid production monitoring. Prioritize Prometheus integrations, as this is what we expect to be used in production environments. Offer logging support (i.e. printing metrics to the info log) for ad-hoc testing, debugging, development, and exploratory use cases. Background¶ Metrics in vLLM can be categorized as follows: Server-level metrics: Global metrics that track the state and performance of the LLM engine. These are typically exposed as Gauges or Counters in Prometheus. Request-level metrics: Metrics that track the characteristics (e.g. size and timing) of individual requests. These are typically exposed as Histograms in Prometheus and are often the SLOs that an SRE monitoring vLLM will be tracking. The mental model is that server-level metrics help explain the values of request-level metrics. Metrics Overview¶ v1 Metrics¶ In v1, an extensive set of metrics are exposed via a Prometheus-compatible /metrics endpoint using the vllm: prefix, for example: vllm:num_requests_running (Gauge) - Number of requests currently running. vllm:kv_cache_usage_perc (Gauge) - Fraction of used KV cache blocks (0–1). vllm:prefix_cache_queries (Counter) - Number of prefix cache queries. vllm:prefix_cache_hits (Counter) - Number of prefix cache hits. vllm:prompt_tokens_total (Counter) - Total number of prompt tokens processed. vllm:generation_tokens_total (Counter) - Total number of generated tokens. vllm:request_success_total (Counter) - Number of finished requests (by finish reason). vllm:request_prompt_tokens (Histogram) - Histogram of input prompt token counts. vllm:request_generation_tokens (Histogram) - Histogram of generation token counts. vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds (Histogram) - Time to first token (TTFT). vllm:inter_token_latency_seconds (Histogram) - Inter-token latency. vllm:e2e_request_latency_seconds (Histogram) - End-to-end request latency. vllm:request_prefill_time_seconds (Histogram) - Request prefill time. vllm:request_decode_time_seconds (Histogram) - Request decode time. These are documented under Inferencing and Serving -> Production Metrics. Grafana Dashboard¶ vLLM also provides a reference example for how to collect and store these metrics using Prometheus and visualize them using a Grafana dashboard. The subset of metrics exposed in the Grafana dashboard gives us an indication of which metrics are especially important: vllm:e2e_request_latency_seconds_bucket - End to end request latency measured in seconds. vllm:prompt_tokens - Prompt tokens. vllm:generation_tokens - Generation tokens. vllm:time_per_output_token_seconds - Inter-token latency (Time Per Output Token, TPOT) in seconds. vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds - Time to First Token (TTFT) latency in seconds. vllm:num_requests_running (also, _swapped and _waiting) - Number of requests in the RUNNING, WAITING, and SWAPPED states. vllm:kv_cache_usage_perc - Percentage of used cache blocks by vLLM. vllm:request_prompt_tokens - Request prompt length. vllm:request_generation_tokens - Request generation length. vllm:request_success - Number of finished requests by their finish reason: either an EOS token was generated or the max sequence length was reached. vllm:request_queue_time_seconds - Queue time. vllm:request_prefill_time_seconds - Requests prefill time. vllm:request_decode_time_seconds - Requests decode time. vllm:request_max_num_generation_tokens - Max generation tokens in a sequence group. See the PR which added this Dashboard for interesting and useful background on the choices made here. Prometheus Client Library¶ Prometheus support was initially added using the aioprometheus library, but a switch was made quickly to prometheus_client. The rationale is discussed in both linked PRs. During those migrations we briefly lost a MetricsMiddleware to track HTTP metrics, but this was reinstated using prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator: $ curl http://0.0.0.0:8000/metrics 2>/dev/null | grep -P '^http_(?!.*(_bucket|_created|_sum)).*' http_requests_total{handler=\"/v1/completions\",method=\"POST\",status=\"2xx\"} 201.0 http_request_size_bytes_count{handler=\"/v1/completions\"} 201.0 http_response_size_bytes_count{handler=\"/v1/completions\"} 201.0 http_request_duration_highr_seconds_count 201.0 http_request_duration_seconds_count{handler=\"/v1/completions\",method=\"POST\"} 201.0 Multi-process Mode¶ Historically, metrics were collected in the engine core process and multiprocess mode was used to make them available in the API server process. See Pull Request #7279. More recently, metrics are collected in the API server process and multiprocess mode is only used when --api-server-count > 1. See Pull Request #17546 and details on API server scale-out. Built in Python/Process Metrics¶ The following metrics are supported by default by prometheus_client, but they are not exposed when multiprocess mode is used: python_gc_objects_collected_total python_gc_objects_uncollectable_total python_gc_collections_total python_info process_virtual_memory_bytes process_resident_memory_bytes process_start_time_seconds process_cpu_seconds_total process_open_fds process_max_fds Therefore, these metrics are unavailable when --api-server-count > 1. It's questionable how relevant these are since they do not aggregate these stats for all processes that make up a vLLM instance. Metrics Design¶ The \"Even Better Observability\" feature where was where much of the metrics design was planned. For example, see where a detailed roadmap was laid out. Legacy PRs¶ To help understand the background to the metrics design, here are some of the relevant PRs which added the original, now legacy, metrics: Pull Request #1890 Pull Request #2316 Pull Request #2730 Pull Request #4464 Pull Request #7279 Metrics Implementation PRs¶ For background, here are the relevant PRs relating to the metrics implementation Issue #10582: Pull Request #11962 Pull Request #11973 Pull Request #10907 Pull Request #12416 Pull Request #12478 Pull Request #12516 Pull Request #12530 Pull Request #12561 Pull Request #12579 Pull Request #12592 Pull Request #12644 Metrics Collection¶ In v1, we wish to move computation and overhead out of the engine core process to minimize the time between each forward pass. The overall idea of V1 EngineCore design is: EngineCore is the inner loop. Performance is most critical here AsyncLLM is the outer loop. This is overlapped with GPU execution (ideally), so this is where any \"overheads\" should be if possible. So AsyncLLM.output_handler_loop is the ideal place for the metrics bookkeeping if possible. We will achieve this by collecting metrics in the frontend API server, and base these metrics on information we can glean from the EngineCoreOutputs returned by the engine core process to the frontend. Interval Calculations¶ Many of our metrics are the time interval between various events in the processing of a request. It is best practice to use timestamps based on \"monotonic time\" (time.monotonic()) rather than \"wall-clock time\" (time.time()) to calculate intervals as the former is unaffected by system clock changes (e.g. from NTP). It's also important to note that monotonic clocks differ between processes - each process has its own reference point. So it is meaningless to compare monotonic timestamps from different processes. Therefore, in order to calculate an interval, we must compare two monotonic timestamps from the same process. Scheduler Stats¶ The engine core process will collect some key statistics from the scheduler - e.g. the number of requests that were scheduled or waiting after the last scheduler pass - and include those statistics in EngineCoreOutputs. Engine Core Events¶ The engine core will also record the timestamp of certain per-request events so that the frontend can calculate the interval between these events. The events are: QUEUED - when the request was received by the engine core and added to the scheduler queue. SCHEDULED - when the request was first scheduled for execution. PREEMPTED - the request has been put back in the waiting queue in order to make room for other requests to complete. It will be re-scheduled in future and re-start its prefill phase. NEW_TOKENS - when the output included in EngineCoreOutput was generated. Since this is common to all requests in a given iteration, we use a single timestamp on EngineCoreOutputs to record this event. And the calculated intervals are: Queue interval - between QUEUED and most recent SCHEDULED. Prefill interval - between most recent SCHEDULED and the subsequent first NEW_TOKENS. Decode interval - between first (after the most recent SCHEDULED) and last NEW_TOKENS. Inference interval - between most recent SCHEDULED and last NEW_TOKENS. Inter-token interval - between successive NEW_TOKENS. Put another way: We explored the possibility of having the frontend calculate these intervals using the timing of events visible by the frontend. However, the frontend does not have visibility into the timing of the QUEUED and SCHEDULED events and, since we need to calculate intervals based on monotonic timestamps from the same process ... we need the engine core to record timestamps for all of these events. Interval Calculations vs Preemptions¶ When a preemption occurs during decode, since any already generated tokens are reused, we consider the preemption as affecting the inter-token, decode, and inference intervals. When a preemption occurs during prefill (assuming such an event is possible), we consider the preemption as affecting the time-to-first-token and prefill intervals. Frontend Stats Collection¶ As the frontend processes a single EngineCoreOutputs - i.e. the output from a single engine core iteration - it collects various statistics relating to that iteration: The total number of new tokens generated in this iteration. The total number of prompt tokens processed by the prefills that completed in this iteration. The queue intervals for any requests that were scheduled in this iteration. The prefill intervals for any requests that completed prefill in this iteration. The inter-token intervals (Time Per Output Token, TPOT), for all requests included in this iteration. The Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) for any requests that completed prefill in this iteration. However, we calculate this interval relative to when the request was first received by the frontend (arrival_time) in order to account for input processing time. For any requests that were completed in a given iteration, we also record: The inference and decode intervals - relative to the scheduled and first token events, as described above. End-to-end latency - the interval between frontend arrival_time and the frontend receiving the final token. KV Cache Residency Metrics¶ We also emit a set of histograms that describe how long sampled KV cache blocks stay resident and how often they are reused. Sampling (--kv-cache-metrics-sample) keeps the overhead tiny; when a block is chosen we record: lifetime – allocation ⟶ eviction idle before eviction – last touch ⟶ eviction reuse gaps – the pauses between touches when the block gets reused Those map directly to the Prometheus metrics: vllm:kv_block_lifetime_seconds – how long each sampled block exists. vllm:kv_block_idle_before_evict_seconds – idle tail after the final access. vllm:kv_block_reuse_gap_seconds – time between consecutive touches. The engine core only ships raw eviction events via SchedulerStats; the frontend drains them, turns them into Prometheus observations, and also exposes the same data through LLM.get_metrics() when logging is on. Looking at lifetime and idle time on one chart makes it easy to spot stranded cache or workloads that pin prompts for a long decode. Metrics Publishing - Logging¶ The LoggingStatLogger metrics publisher outputs a log INFO message every 5 seconds with some key metrics: The current number of running/waiting requests The current GPU cache usage The number of prompt tokens processed per second over the past 5 seconds The number of new tokens generated per second over the past 5 seconds The prefix cache hit rate over the most recent 1k kv-cache block queries Metrics Publishing - Prometheus¶ The PrometheusStatLogger metrics publisher makes the metrics available via a /metrics HTTP endpoint in a Prometheus-compatible format. A Prometheus instance can then be configured to poll this endpoint (e.g. every second) and record the values in its time-series database. Prometheus is often used via Grafana, allowing these metrics to be graphed over time. Prometheus supports the following metric types: Counter: a value that will increase over time, never reducing, and generally reset to zero when the vLLM instance restarts. For example, the number of tokens generated over the lifetime of the instance. Gauge: a value that goes up and down, for example the number of requests currently scheduled for execution. Histogram: a count of metric samples, recorded in buckets. For example, the number of requests whose TTFT was <1ms, <5ms, <10ms, <20ms, and so on. Prometheus metrics can also be labelled, allowing metrics to be combined according to matching labels. In vLLM, we add a model_name label to every metric which includes the name of the model served by that instance. Example output: $ curl http://0.0.0.0:8000/metrics # HELP vllm:num_requests_running Number of requests in model execution batches. # TYPE vllm:num_requests_running gauge vllm:num_requests_running{model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 8.0 ... # HELP vllm:generation_tokens_total Number of generation tokens processed. # TYPE vllm:generation_tokens_total counter vllm:generation_tokens_total{model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 27453.0 ... # HELP vllm:request_success_total Count of successfully processed requests. # TYPE vllm:request_success_total counter vllm:request_success_total{finished_reason=\"stop\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 1.0 vllm:request_success_total{finished_reason=\"length\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 131.0 vllm:request_success_total{finished_reason=\"abort\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 0.0 ... # HELP vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds Histogram of time to first token in seconds. # TYPE vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds histogram vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds_bucket{le=\"0.001\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 0.0 vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds_bucket{le=\"0.005\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 0.0 vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds_bucket{le=\"0.01\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 0.0 vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds_bucket{le=\"0.02\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 13.0 vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds_bucket{le=\"0.04\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 97.0 vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds_bucket{le=\"0.06\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 123.0 vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds_bucket{le=\"0.08\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 138.0 vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds_bucket{le=\"0.1\",model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 140.0 vllm:time_to_first_token_seconds_count{model_name=\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"} 140.0 Note The choice of histogram buckets to be most useful to users across a broad set of use cases is not straightforward and will require refinement over time. Cache Config Info¶ prometheus_client has support for Info metrics which are equivalent to a Gauge whose value is permanently set to 1, but exposes interesting key/value pair information via labels. This is used for information about an instance that does not change - so it only needs to be observed at startup - and allows comparing across instances in Prometheus. We use this concept for the vllm:cache_config_info metric: # HELP vllm:cache_config_info Information of the LLMEngine CacheConfig # TYPE vllm:cache_config_info gauge vllm:cache_config_info{block_size=\"16\",cache_dtype=\"auto\",calculate_kv_scales=\"False\",cpu_offload_gb=\"0\",enable_prefix_caching=\"False\",gpu_memory_utilization=\"0.9\",...} 1.0 However, prometheus_client has never supported Info metrics in multiprocessing mode - for unclear reasons. We simply use a Gauge metric set to 1 and multiprocess_mode=\"mostrecent\" instead. LoRA Metrics¶ The vllm:lora_requests_info Gauge is somewhat similar, except the value is the current wall-clock time, and is updated every iteration. The label names used are: running_lora_adapters: a per-adapter count of the number requests running using that adapter, formatted as a comma-separated string. waiting_lora_adapters: similar, except counting requests that are waiting to be scheduled. max_lora - the static \"max number of LoRAs in a single batch.\" configuration. Encoding a running/waiting counts for multiple adapters in a comma-separated string seems quite misguided - we could use labels to distinguish between per-adapter counts. This should be revisited. Note that multiprocess_mode=\"livemostrecent\" is used - the most recent metric is used, but only from currently running processes. This was added in Pull Request #9477 and there is at least one known user. If we revisit this design and deprecate the old metric, we should coordinate with downstream users so they can migrate before the removal. Prefix Cache metrics¶ The discussion in Issue #10582 about adding prefix cache metrics yielded some interesting points which may be relevant to how we approach future metrics. Every time the prefix cache is queried, we record the number of tokens queried and the number of queried tokens present in the cache (i.e. hits). However, the metric of interest is the hit rate - i.e. the number of hits per query. In the case of logging, we expect the user is best served by calculating the hit rate over a fixed number of the most recent queries (the interval is fixed to 1k most recent queries for now). In the case of Prometheus though, we should take advantage of the time-series nature of Prometheus and allow the user to calculate the hit rate over an interval of their choosing. For example, a PromQL query to calculate the hit interval of the past 5 minutes: rate(cache_query_hit[5m]) / rate(cache_query_total[5m]) To achieve this, we should record the queries and hits as counters in Prometheus, rather than recording the hit rate as a gauge. Deprecated Metrics¶ How To Deprecate¶ Deprecating metrics shouldn't be taken lightly. Users may not notice a metric has been deprecated, and may be quite inconvenienced when it is suddenly (from their perspective) when it is removed, even if there is an equivalent metric for them to use. As an example, see how vllm:avg_prompt_throughput_toks_per_s was deprecated (with a comment in the code), removed, and then noticed by a user. In general: We should be cautious about deprecating metrics, especially since it can be hard to predict the user impact. We should include a prominent deprecation notice in the help string that is included in the `/metrics' output. We should list deprecated metrics in user-facing documentation and release notes. We should consider hiding deprecated metrics behind a CLI argument in order to give administrators an escape hatch for some time before deleting them. See the deprecation policy for the project-wide deprecation policy. Unimplemented - vllm:tokens_total¶ Added by Pull Request #4464, but apparently never implemented. This can just be removed. Duplicated - Queue Time¶ The vllm:time_in_queue_requests Histogram metric was added by Pull Request #9659 and its calculation is: self.metrics.first_scheduled_time = now self.metrics.time_in_queue = now - self.metrics.arrival_time Two weeks later, Pull Request #4464 added vllm:request_queue_time_seconds leaving us with: if seq_group.is_finished(): if (seq_group.metrics.first_scheduled_time is not None and seq_group.metrics.first_token_time is not None): time_queue_requests.append( seq_group.metrics.first_scheduled_time - seq_group.metrics.arrival_time) ... if seq_group.metrics.time_in_queue is not None: time_in_queue_requests.append( seq_group.metrics.time_in_queue) This seems duplicative, and one of them should be removed. The latter is used by the Grafana dashboard, so we should deprecate or remove the former. Prefix Cache Hit Rate¶ See above - we now expose 'queries' and 'hits' counters rather than a 'hit rate' gauge. KV Cache Offloading¶ Two legacy metrics relate to a \"swapped\" preemption mode that is no longer relevant in v1: vllm:num_requests_swapped vllm:cpu_cache_usage_perc In this mode, when a request is preempted (e.g. to make room in KV cache to complete other requests), we swap kv cache blocks out to CPU memory. This is also known as \"KV cache offloading\" and is configured with --swap-space and --preemption-mode. Historically, vLLM has long supported beam search. The SequenceGroup encapsulated the idea of N Sequences which all shared the same prompt kv blocks. This enabled KV cache block sharing between requests, and copy-on-write to do branching. CPU swapping was intended for these beam search like cases. Later, the concept of prefix caching was introduced, which allowed KV cache blocks to be shared implicitly. This proved to be a better option than CPU swapping since blocks can be evicted slowly on demand and the part of the prompt that was evicted can be recomputed. SequenceGroup was removed in V1, although a replacement will be required for \"parallel sampling\" (n>1). Beam search was moved out of the core. There was a lot of complex code for a very uncommon feature. In V1, with prefix caching being better (zero over head) and therefore on by default, the preemption and recompute strategy should work better. Future Work¶ Parallel Sampling¶ Some legacy metrics are only relevant in the context of \"parallel sampling\". This is where the n parameter in a request is used to request multiple completions from the same prompt. As part of adding parallel sampling support in Pull Request #10980, we should also add these metrics. vllm:request_params_n (Histogram) Observes the value of the 'n' parameter of every finished request. vllm:request_max_num_generation_tokens (Histogram) Observes the maximum output length of all sequences in every finished sequence group. In the absence of parallel sampling, this is equivalent to vllm:request_generation_tokens. Speculative Decoding¶ Some legacy metrics are specific to \"speculative decoding\". This is where we generate candidate tokens using a faster, approximate method or model and then validate those tokens with the larger model. vllm:spec_decode_draft_acceptance_rate (Gauge) vllm:spec_decode_efficiency (Gauge) vllm:spec_decode_num_accepted_tokens (Counter) vllm:spec_decode_num_draft_tokens (Counter) vllm:spec_decode_num_emitted_tokens (Counter) There is a PR under review ( Pull Request #12193) to add \"prompt lookup (ngram)\" speculative decoding to v1. Other techniques will follow. We should revisit these metrics in this context. Note We should probably expose acceptance rate as separate accepted and draft counters, like we do for prefix caching hit rate. Efficiency likely also needs similar treatment. Autoscaling and Load-balancing¶ A common use case for our metrics is to support automated scaling of vLLM instances. For related discussion from the Kubernetes Serving Working Group, see: Standardizing Large Model Server Metrics in Kubernetes Benchmarking LLM Workloads for Performance Evaluation and Autoscaling in Kubernetes Inference Perf Issue #5041 and Pull Request #12726. This is a non-trivial topic. Consider this comment from Rob: I think this metric should focus on trying to estimate what the max concurrency that will cause the average request length > queries per second ... since this is really what will \"saturate\" the server. A clear goal is that we should expose the metrics required to detect this saturation point, so administrators can implement auto-scaling rules based on those. However, in order to do so, we need to have a clear view on how an administrator (and automated monitoring system) should judge an instance as approaching saturation: To identify, what is the saturation point for model server compute (the inflection point where we cannot get more throughput with a higher request rate, but start to incur additional latency) so we can autoscale effectively? Metric Naming¶ Our approach to naming metrics probably deserves to be revisited: The use of colons in metric names seems contrary to \"colons are reserved for user defined recording rules\". Most of our metrics follow the convention of ending with units, but not all do. Some of our metric names end with _total: If there is a suffix of _total on the metric name, it will be removed. When exposing the time series for counter, a _total suffix will be added. This is for compatibility between OpenMetrics and the Prometheus text format, as OpenMetrics requires the _total suffix. Adding More Metrics¶ There is no shortage of ideas for new metrics: Examples from other projects like TGI Proposals arising from specific use cases, like the Kubernetes auto-scaling topic above Proposals that might arise out of standardisation efforts like OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for Gen AI. We should be cautious in our approach to adding new metrics. While metrics are often relatively straightforward to add: They can be difficult to remove - see the section on deprecation above. They can have a meaningful performance impact when enabled. And metrics are usually of very limited use unless they can be enabled by default and in production. They have an impact on development and maintenance of the project. Every metric added over time has made this effort more time-consuming, and perhaps not all metrics justify this ongoing investment in their maintenance. Tracing - OpenTelemetry¶ Metrics provide an aggregated view over time of the system's performance and health. Tracing, on the other hand, tracks individual requests as they move through different services and components. Both fall under the more general heading of \"Observability\". vLLM has support for OpenTelemetry tracing: Added by Pull Request #4687 and reinstated by Pull Request #20372 Configured with --oltp-traces-endpoint and --collect-detailed-traces OpenTelemetry blog post User-facing docs Blog post IBM product docs OpenTelemetry has a Gen AI Working Group. Since metrics is a big enough topic on its own, we consider the topic of tracing to be quite separate from metrics. OpenTelemetry Model Forward vs Execute Time¶ The current implementation exposes the following two metrics: vllm:model_forward_time_milliseconds (Histogram) - The time spent in the model forward pass when this request was in the batch. vllm:model_execute_time_milliseconds (Histogram) - The time spent in the model execute function. This will include model forward, block/sync across workers, cpu-gpu sync time and sampling time. These metrics are only enabled when OpenTelemetry tracing is enabled and if --collect-detailed-traces=all/model/worker is used. The documentation for this option states: collect detailed traces for the specified modules. This involves use of possibly costly and or blocking operations and hence might have a performance impact. The metrics were added by Pull Request #7089 and who up in an OpenTelemetry trace as: -> gen_ai.latency.time_in_scheduler: Double(0.017550230026245117) -> gen_ai.latency.time_in_model_forward: Double(3.151565277099609) -> gen_ai.latency.time_in_model_execute: Double(3.6468167304992676) We already have inference_time and decode_time metrics, so the question is whether there are sufficiently common use cases for the higher-resolution timings to justify the overhead. Since we are going to treat the question of OpenTelemetry support separately, we will include these particular metrics under that topic. December 10, 2025",
