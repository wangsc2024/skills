  "content": "This document walks you through the steps to extend a basic model so that it accepts multi-modal inputs.\n\nIt is assumed that you have already implemented the model in vLLM according to these steps. Further update the model as follows:\n\nImplement get_placeholder_str to define the placeholder string which is used to represent the multi-modal item in the text prompt. This should be consistent with the chat template of the model.\n\nReserve a keyword parameter in forward for each input tensor that corresponds to a multi-modal input, as shown in the following example:\n\nMore conveniently, you can simply pass **kwargs to the forward method and retrieve the keyword parameters for multimodal inputs from it.\n\nImplement embed_multimodal that returns the embeddings from running the multimodal inputs through the multimodal tokenizer of the model. Below we provide a boilerplate of a typical implementation pattern, but feel free to adjust it to your own needs.\n\nThe returned multimodal_embeddings must be either a 3D torch.Tensor of shape (num_items, feature_size, hidden_size), or a list / tuple of 2D torch.Tensor's of shape (feature_size, hidden_size), so that multimodal_embeddings[i] retrieves the embeddings generated from the i-th multimodal data item (e.g, image) of the request.\n\nBy default, vLLM merges the multimodal embeddings into text embeddings depending on the information of their locations defined in PlaceholderRange from input processing. This logic can be found at embed_input_ids.\n\nYou may override this method if additional logic is required for your model when merging embeddings.\n\nImplement get_language_model getter to provide stable access to the underlying language model.\n\nOnce the above steps are done, update the model class with the SupportsMultiModal interface.\n\nThe model class does not have to be named *ForCausalLM. Check out the HuggingFace Transformers documentation for some examples.\n\nNext, create a subclass of BaseProcessingInfo to provide basic information related to HF processing.\n\nYou need to override the abstract method get_supported_mm_limits to return the maximum number of input items for each modality supported by the model.\n\nFor example, if the model supports any number of images but only one video per prompt:\n\nThen, inherit BaseDummyInputsBuilder to construct dummy inputs for HF processing as well as memory profiling.\n\nOverride the abstract methods get_dummy_text and get_dummy_mm_data to construct dummy inputs for memory profiling. These dummy inputs should result in the worst-case memory usage of the model so that vLLM can reserve the correct amount of memory for it.\n\nAssuming that the memory usage increases with the number of tokens, the dummy inputs can be constructed to maximize the number of output embeddings, which is the same number as placeholder feature tokens.\n\nLooking at the code of HF's LlavaForConditionalGeneration:\n\nThe number of placeholder feature tokens per image is image_features.shape[1]. image_features is calculated inside the get_image_features method:\n\nWe can infer that image_features.shape[1] is based on image_outputs.hidden_states.shape[1] from the vision tower (CLIPVisionModel for the llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf model). Moreover, we only need the sequence length (the second dimension of the tensor) to get image_features.shape[1]. The sequence length is determined by the initial hidden states in CLIPVisionTransformer since the attention mechanism doesn't change the sequence length of the output hidden states.\n\nTo find the sequence length, we turn to the code of CLIPVisionEmbeddings:\n\nWe can infer that embeddings.shape[1] == self.num_positions, where\n\nOverall, the number of placeholder feature tokens for an image can be calculated as:\n\nNotice that the number of image tokens doesn't depend on the image width and height. We can simply use a dummy image_size to calculate the multimodal profiling data:\n\nFor the text, we simply expand the multimodal image token from the model config to match the desired number of images.\n\nLooking at the code of HF's FuyuForCausalLM:\n\nThe number of placeholder feature tokens for the ith item in the batch is patch_embeddings[i].shape[0], which is the same as image_patches[i].shape[0], i.e. num_total_patches.\n\nUnlike LLaVA, Fuyu does not define the number of patches inside the modeling file. Where can we get more information? Considering that the model input comes from the output of FuyuProcessor, let's look at the preprocessing files.\n\nThe image outputs are obtained by calling FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess and then FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess_with_tokenizer_info inside FuyuProcessor.\n\nIn FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess, the images are resized and padded to the target FuyuImageProcessor.size, returning the dimensions after resizing (but before padding) as metadata.\n\nIn FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess_with_tokenizer_info, the images are split into patches based on this metadata:\n\nThe number of patches is in turn defined by FuyuImageProcessor.get_num_patches:\n\nThese image patches correspond to placeholder tokens (|SPEAKER|). So, we just need to maximize the number of image patches. Since input images are first resized to fit within image_processor.size, we can maximize the number of image patches by inputting an image with size equal to image_processor.size.\n\nFuyu does not expect image placeholders in the inputs to HF processor, so the dummy prompt text is empty regardless of the number of images.\n\nFor the multimodal image profiling data, the logic is very similar to LLaVA:\n\nAfterwards, create a subclass of BaseMultiModalProcessor to fill in the missing details about HF processing.\n\nMulti-Modal Data Processing\n\nOverride _get_mm_fields_config to return a schema of the tensors outputted by the HF processor that are related to the input multi-modal items.\n\nThe output of CLIPImageProcessor is a simple tensor with shape (num_images, num_channels, image_height, image_width):\n\nSo, we override _get_mm_fields_config as follows:\n\nOur actual code additionally supports pre-computed image embeddings, which can be passed to be model via the image_embeds argument.\n\nThe image_patches output of FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess_with_tokenizer_info concatenates the patches from each image belonging to an item in the batch:\n\nThe shape of image_patches outputted by FuyuImageProcessor is therefore (1, num_images, num_patches, patch_width * patch_height * num_channels).\n\nIn order to support the use of MultiModalFieldConfig.batched like in LLaVA, we remove the extra batch dimension by overriding BaseMultiModalProcessor._call_hf_processor:\n\nOur actual code has special handling for text-only inputs to prevent unnecessary warnings from HF processor.\n\nThe _call_hf_processor method specifies both mm_kwargs and tok_kwargs for processing. mm_kwargs is used to both initialize and call the huggingface processor, whereas tok_kwargs is only used to call the huggingface processor.\n\nThis lets us override _get_mm_fields_config as follows:\n\nOverride _get_prompt_updates to return a list of PromptUpdate instances.\n\nEach PromptUpdate instance specifies an update operation (e.g.: insertion, replacement) performed by the HF processor.\n\nLooking at HF's LlavaProcessor:\n\nIt simply repeats each input image_token a number of times equal to the number of placeholder feature tokens (num_image_tokens). Based on this, we override _get_prompt_updates as follows:\n\nRecall the layout of feature tokens from Step 2:\n\nWe define a helper function to return ncols and nrows directly:\n\nBased on this, we can initially define our replacement tokens as:\n\nHowever, this is not entirely correct. After FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess_with_tokenizer_info is called, a BOS token (<s>) is also added to the promopt:\n\nTo assign the vision embeddings to only the image tokens, instead of a string you can return an instance of PromptUpdateDetails:\n\nFinally, noticing that the HF processor removes the |ENDOFTEXT| token from the tokenized prompt, we can search for it to conduct the replacement at the start of the string:\n\nAfter you have defined BaseProcessingInfo (Step 2), BaseDummyInputsBuilder (Step 3), and BaseMultiModalProcessor (Step 4), decorate the model class with MULTIMODAL_REGISTRY.register_processor to register them to the multi-modal registry:\n\nSome HF processors directly insert feature tokens without replacing anything in the original prompt. In that case, you can use PromptInsertion instead of PromptReplacement inside _get_prompt_updates.\n\n_get_prompt_updates assumes that each application of prompt update corresponds to one multi-modal item. If the HF processor performs additional processing regardless of how many multi-modal items there are, you should override _apply_hf_processor_tokens_only so that the processed token inputs are consistent with the result of applying the HF processor on text inputs. This is because token inputs bypass the HF processor according to our design.\n\nSome models don't define an HF processor class on HF Hub. In that case, you can define a custom HF processor that has the same call signature as HF processors and pass it to _call_hf_processor.",

Specify processing details Multi-modal fields Prompt updates 5. Register processor-related classes Notes Inserting feature tokens without replacement Handling prompt updates unrelated to multi-modal data Custom HF processor Multi-Modal Support¶ This document walks you through the steps to extend a basic model so that it accepts multi-modal inputs. 1. Update the base vLLM model¶ It is assumed that you have already implemented the model in vLLM according to these steps. Further update the model as follows: Implement get_placeholder_str to define the placeholder string which is used to represent the multi-modal item in the text prompt. This should be consistent with the chat template of the model. Code class YourModelForImage2Seq(nn.Module): ... @classmethod def get_placeholder_str(cls, modality: str, i: int) -> str | None: if modality.startswith(\"image\"): return \"<image>\" raise ValueError(\"Only image modality is supported\") Reserve a keyword parameter in forward for each input tensor that corresponds to a multi-modal input, as shown in the following example: def forward( self, input_ids: torch.Tensor, positions: torch.Tensor, + pixel_values: torch.Tensor, ) -> SamplerOutput: More conveniently, you can simply pass **kwargs to the forward method and retrieve the keyword parameters for multimodal inputs from it. Implement embed_multimodal that returns the embeddings from running the multimodal inputs through the multimodal tokenizer of the model. Below we provide a boilerplate of a typical implementation pattern, but feel free to adjust it to your own needs. Code class YourModelForImage2Seq(nn.Module): ... def _process_image_input(self, image_input: YourModelImageInputs) -> torch.Tensor: assert self.vision_encoder is not None image_features = self.vision_encoder(image_input) return self.multi_modal_projector(image_features) def embed_multimodal( self, **kwargs: object, ) -> MultiModalEmbeddings | None: # Validate the multimodal input keyword arguments image_input = self._parse_and_validate_image_input(**kwargs) if image_input is None: return None # Run multimodal inputs through encoder and projector vision_embeddings = self._process_image_input(image_input) return vision_embeddings Important The returned multimodal_embeddings must be either a 3D torch.Tensor of shape (num_items, feature_size, hidden_size), or a list / tuple of 2D torch.Tensor's of shape (feature_size, hidden_size), so that multimodal_embeddings[i] retrieves the embeddings generated from the i-th multimodal data item (e.g, image) of the request. Note By default, vLLM merges the multimodal embeddings into text embeddings depending on the information of their locations defined in PlaceholderRange from input processing. This logic can be found at embed_input_ids. You may override this method if additional logic is required for your model when merging embeddings. Implement get_language_model getter to provide stable access to the underlying language model. class YourModelForImage2Seq(nn.Module): ... def get_language_model(self) -> torch.nn.Module: # Change `language_model` according to your implementation. return self.language_model Once the above steps are done, update the model class with the SupportsMultiModal interface. + from vllm.model_executor.models.interfaces import SupportsMultiModal - class YourModelForImage2Seq(nn.Module): + class YourModelForImage2Seq(nn.Module, SupportsMultiModal): Note The model class does not have to be named *ForCausalLM. Check out the HuggingFace Transformers documentation for some examples. 2. Specify processing information¶ Next, create a subclass of BaseProcessingInfo to provide basic information related to HF processing. Maximum number of input items¶ You need to override the abstract method get_supported_mm_limits to return the maximum number of input items for each modality supported by the model. For example, if the model supports any number of images but only one video per prompt: def get_supported_mm_limits(self) -> Mapping[str, int | None]: return {\"image\": None, \"video\": 1} 3. Specify dummy inputs¶ Then, inherit BaseDummyInputsBuilder to construct dummy inputs for HF processing as well as memory profiling. For memory profiling¶ Override the abstract methods get_dummy_text and get_dummy_mm_data to construct dummy inputs for memory profiling. These dummy inputs should result in the worst-case memory usage of the model so that vLLM can reserve the correct amount of memory for it. Assuming that the memory usage increases with the number of tokens, the dummy inputs can be constructed to maximize the number of output embeddings, which is the same number as placeholder feature tokens. Basic example: LLaVANo input placeholders: Fuyu Looking at the code of HF's LlavaForConditionalGeneration: Code # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.47.1/src/transformers/models/llava/modeling_llava.py#L530-L544 n_image_tokens = (input_ids == self.config.image_token_index).sum().item() n_image_features = image_features.shape[0] * image_features.shape[1] if n_image_tokens != n_image_features: raise ValueError( f\"Image features and image tokens do not match: tokens: {n_image_tokens}, features {n_image_features}\" ) special_image_mask = ( (input_ids == self.config.image_token_index) .unsqueeze(-1) .expand_as(inputs_embeds) .to(inputs_embeds.device) ) image_features = image_features.to(inputs_embeds.device, inputs_embeds.dtype) inputs_embeds = inputs_embeds.masked_scatter(special_image_mask, image_features) The number of placeholder feature tokens per image is image_features.shape[1]. image_features is calculated inside the get_image_features method: Code # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.47.1/src/transformers/models/llava/modeling_llava.py#L290-L300 image_outputs = self.vision_tower(pixel_values, output_hidden_states=True) selected_image_feature = image_outputs.hidden_states[vision_feature_layer] if vision_feature_select_strategy == \"default\": selected_image_feature = selected_image_feature[:, 1:] elif vision_feature_select_strategy == \"full\": selected_image_feature = selected_image_feature else: raise ValueError(f\"Unexpected select feature strategy: {self.config.vision_feature_select_strategy}\") image_features = self.multi_modal_projector(selected_image_feature) return image_features We can infer that image_features.shape[1] is based on image_outputs.hidden_states.shape[1] from the vision tower (CLIPVisionModel for the llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf model). Moreover, we only need the sequence length (the second dimension of the tensor) to get image_features.shape[1]. The sequence length is determined by the initial hidden states in CLIPVisionTransformer since the attention mechanism doesn't change the sequence length of the output hidden states. # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.47.1/src/transformers/models/clip/modeling_clip.py#L1094-L1102 hidden_states = self.embeddings(pixel_values, interpolate_pos_encoding=interpolate_pos_encoding) hidden_states = self.pre_layrnorm(hidden_states) encoder_outputs = self.encoder( inputs_embeds=hidden_states, output_attentions=output_attentions, output_hidden_states=output_hidden_states, return_dict=return_dict, ) To find the sequence length, we turn to the code of CLIPVisionEmbeddings: Code # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.47.1/src/transformers/models/clip/modeling_clip.py#L247-L257 target_dtype = self.patch_embedding.weight.dtype patch_embeds = self.patch_embedding(pixel_values.to(dtype=target_dtype)) # shape = [*, width, grid, grid] patch_embeds = patch_embeds.flatten(2).transpose(1, 2) class_embeds = self.class_embedding.expand(batch_size, 1, -1) embeddings = torch.cat([class_embeds, patch_embeds], dim=1) if interpolate_pos_encoding: embeddings = embeddings + self.interpolate_pos_encoding(embeddings, height, width) else: embeddings = embeddings + self.position_embedding(self.position_ids) return embeddings We can infer that embeddings.shape[1] == self.num_positions, where # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.47.1/src/transformers/models/clip/modeling_clip.py#L195-L196 self.num_patches = (self.image_size // self.patch_size) ** 2 self.num_positions = self.num_patches + 1 Overall, the number of placeholder feature tokens for an image can be calculated as: Code def get_num_image_tokens( self, *, image_width: int, image_height: int, ) -> int: hf_config = self.get_hf_config() hf_processor = self.get_hf_processor() image_size = hf_config.vision_config.image_size patch_size = hf_config.vision_config.patch_size num_image_tokens = (image_size // patch_size) ** 2 + 1 if hf_processor.vision_feature_select_strategy == \"default\": num_image_tokens -= 1 return num_image_tokens Notice that the number of image tokens doesn't depend on the image width and height. We can simply use a dummy image_size to calculate the multimodal profiling data: Code # NOTE: In actuality, this is usually implemented as part of the # model's subclass of `BaseProcessingInfo`, but we show it as is # here for simplicity. def get_image_size_with_most_features(self) -> ImageSize: hf_config = self.get_hf_config() width = height = hf_config.image_size return ImageSize(width=width, height=height) def get_dummy_mm_data( self, seq_len: int, mm_counts: Mapping[str, int], mm_options: Mapping[str, BaseDummyOptions] | None = None, ) -> MultiModalDataDict: num_images = mm_counts.get(\"image\", 0) target_width, target_height = \\ self.info.get_image_size_with_most_features() image_overrides = mm_options.get(\"image\") if mm_options else None return { \"image\": self._get_dummy_images(width=target_width, height=target_height, num_images=num_images, overrides=image_overrides) } For the text, we simply expand the multimodal image token from the model config to match the desired number of images. def get_dummy_text(self, mm_counts: Mapping[str, int]) -> str: num_images = mm_counts.get(\"image\", 0) processor = self.info.get_hf_processor() image_token = processor.image_token return image_token * num_images Looking at the code of HF's FuyuForCausalLM: Code # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.48.3/src/transformers/models/fuyu/modeling_fuyu.py#L311-L322 if image_patches is not None and past_key_values is None: patch_embeddings = [ self.vision_embed_tokens(patch.to(self.vision_embed_tokens.weight.dtype)) .squeeze(0) .to(inputs_embeds.device) for patch in image_patches ] inputs_embeds = self.gather_continuous_embeddings( word_embeddings=inputs_embeds, continuous_embeddings=patch_embeddings, image_patch_input_indices=image_patches_indices, ) The number of placeholder feature tokens for the ith item in the batch is patch_embeddings[i].shape[0], which is the same as image_patches[i].shape[0], i.e. num_total_patches. Unlike LLaVA, Fuyu does not define the number of patches inside the modeling file. Where can we get more information? Considering that the model input comes from the output of FuyuProcessor, let's look at the preprocessing files. The image outputs are obtained by calling FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess and then FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess_with_tokenizer_info inside FuyuProcessor. In FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess, the images are resized and padded to the target FuyuImageProcessor.size, returning the dimensions after resizing (but before padding) as metadata. Code # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.48.3/src/transformers/models/fuyu/processing_fuyu.py#L541-L544 image_encoding = self.image_processor.preprocess(images, **output_kwargs[\"images_kwargs\"]) batch_images = image_encoding[\"images\"] image_unpadded_heights = image_encoding[\"image_unpadded_heights\"] image_unpadded_widths = image_encoding[\"image_unpadded_widths\"] # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.48.3/src/transformers/models/fuyu/image_processing_fuyu.py#L480-L if do_resize: batch_images = [ [self.resize(image, size=size, input_data_format=input_data_format) for image in images] for images in batch_images ] image_sizes = [get_image_size(images[0], channel_dim=input_data_format) for images in batch_images] image_unpadded_heights = [[image_size[0]] for image_size in image_sizes] image_unpadded_widths = [[image_size[1]] for image_size in image_sizes] if do_pad: batch_images = [ [ self.pad_image( image, size=size, mode=padding_mode, constant_values=padding_value, input_data_format=input_data_format, ) for image in images ] for images in batch_images ] In FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess_with_tokenizer_info, the images are split into patches based on this metadata: Code # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.48.3/src/transformers/models/fuyu/processing_fuyu.py#L417-L425 model_image_input = self.image_processor.preprocess_with_tokenizer_info( image_input=tensor_batch_images, image_present=image_present, image_unpadded_h=image_unpadded_heights, image_unpadded_w=image_unpadded_widths, image_placeholder_id=image_placeholder_id, image_newline_id=image_newline_id, variable_sized=True, ) # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.48.3/src/transformers/models/fuyu/image_processing_fuyu.py#L638-L658 image_height, image_width = image.shape[1], image.shape[2] if variable_sized: # variable_sized=True new_h = min( image_height, math.ceil(image_unpadded_h[batch_index, subseq_index] / patch_height) * patch_height, ) new_w = min( image_width, math.ceil(image_unpadded_w[batch_index, subseq_index] / patch_width) * patch_width, ) image = image[:, :new_h, :new_w] image_height, image_width = new_h, new_w num_patches = self.get_num_patches(image_height=image_height, image_width=image_width) tensor_of_image_ids = torch.full( [num_patches], image_placeholder_id, dtype=torch.int32, device=image_input.device ) patches = self.patchify_image(image=image.unsqueeze(0)).squeeze(0) assert num_patches == patches.shape[0] The number of patches is in turn defined by FuyuImageProcessor.get_num_patches: Code # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.48.3/src/transformers/models/fuyu/image_processing_fuyu.py#L552-L562 patch_size = patch_size if patch_size is not None else self.patch_size patch_height, patch_width = self.patch_size[\"height\"], self.patch_size[\"width\"] if image_height % patch_height != 0: raise ValueError(f\"{image_height=} must be divisible by {patch_height}\") if image_width % patch_width != 0: raise ValueError(f\"{image_width=} must be divisible by {patch_width}\") num_patches_per_dim_h = image_height // patch_height num_patches_per_dim_w = image_width // patch_width num_patches = num_patches_per_dim_h * num_patches_per_dim_w These image patches correspond to placeholder tokens (|SPEAKER|). So, we just need to maximize the number of image patches. Since input images are first resized to fit within image_processor.size, we can maximize the number of image patches by inputting an image with size equal to image_processor.size. def get_image_size_with_most_features(self) -> ImageSize: image_processor = self.get_image_processor() return ImageSize( width=image_processor.size[\"width\"], height=image_processor.size[\"height\"], ) Fuyu does not expect image placeholders in the inputs to HF processor, so the dummy prompt text is empty regardless of the number of images. def get_dummy_text(self, mm_counts: Mapping[str, int]) -> str: return \"\" For the multimodal image profiling data, the logic is very similar to LLaVA: Code def get_dummy_mm_data( self, seq_len: int, mm_counts: Mapping[str, int], mm_options: Optional[Mapping[str, BaseDummyOptions]] = None, ) -> MultiModalDataDict: target_width, target_height = \\ self.info.get_image_size_with_most_features() num_images = mm_counts.get(\"image\", 0) image_overrides = mm_options.get(\"image\") if mm_options else None return { \"image\": self._get_dummy_images( width=target_width, height=target_height, num_images=num_images, overrides=image_overrides, ) } 4. Specify processing details¶ Afterwards, create a subclass of BaseMultiModalProcessor to fill in the missing details about HF processing. Info Multi-Modal Data Processing Multi-modal fields¶ Override _get_mm_fields_config to return a schema of the tensors outputted by the HF processor that are related to the input multi-modal items. Basic example: LLaVAWith postprocessing: Fuyu The output of CLIPImageProcessor is a simple tensor with shape (num_images, num_channels, image_height, image_width): # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.47.1/src/transformers/models/clip/image_processing_clip.py#L339-L345 images = [ to_channel_dimension_format(image, data_format, input_channel_dim=input_data_format) for image in all_images ] data = {\"pixel_values\": images} return BatchFeature(data=data, tensor_type=return_tensors) So, we override _get_mm_fields_config as follows: def _get_mm_fields_config( self, hf_inputs: BatchFeature, hf_processor_mm_kwargs: Mapping[str, object], ) -> Mapping[str, MultiModalFieldConfig]: return dict( pixel_values=MultiModalFieldConfig.batched(\"image\"), ) Note Our actual code additionally supports pre-computed image embeddings, which can be passed to be model via the image_embeds argument. The image_patches output of FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess_with_tokenizer_info concatenates the patches from each image belonging to an item in the batch: # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.48.3/src/transformers/models/fuyu/image_processing_fuyu.py#L673-L679 image_input_ids.append(tensor_of_image_ids) image_patches.append(patches) else: image_input_ids.append(torch.tensor([], dtype=torch.int32, device=image_input.device)) batch_image_input_ids.append(image_input_ids) batch_image_patches.append(image_patches) The shape of image_patches outputted by FuyuImageProcessor is therefore (1, num_images, num_patches, patch_width * patch_height * num_channels). In order to support the use of MultiModalFieldConfig.batched like in LLaVA, we remove the extra batch dimension by overriding BaseMultiModalProcessor._call_hf_processor: Code def _call_hf_processor( self, prompt: str, mm_data: Mapping[str, object], mm_kwargs: Mapping[str, object], tok_kwargs: Mapping[str, object], ) -> BatchFeature: processed_outputs = super()._call_hf_processor( prompt=prompt, mm_data=mm_data, mm_kwargs=mm_kwargs, tok_kwargs=tok_kwargs, ) image_patches = processed_outputs.get(\"image_patches\") if image_patches is not None: images = mm_data[\"images\"] assert isinstance(images, list) # Original output: (1, num_images, Pn, Px * Py * C) # New output: (num_images, Pn, Px * Py * C) assert (isinstance(image_patches, list) and len(image_patches) == 1) assert (isinstance(image_patches[0], torch.Tensor) and len(image_patches[0]) == len(images)) processed_outputs[\"image_patches\"] = image_patches[0] return processed_outputs Note Our actual code has special handling for text-only inputs to prevent unnecessary warnings from HF processor. Note The _call_hf_processor method specifies both mm_kwargs and tok_kwargs for processing. mm_kwargs is used to both initialize and call the huggingface processor, whereas tok_kwargs is only used to call the huggingface processor. This lets us override _get_mm_fields_config as follows: def _get_mm_fields_config( self, hf_inputs: BatchFeature, hf_processor_mm_kwargs: Mapping[str, object], ) -> Mapping[str, MultiModalFieldConfig]: return dict(image_patches=MultiModalFieldConfig.batched(\"image\")) Prompt updates¶ Override _get_prompt_updates to return a list of PromptUpdate instances. Each PromptUpdate instance specifies an update operation (e.g.: insertion, replacement) performed by the HF processor. Basic example: LLaVAHandling additional tokens: Fuyu Looking at HF's LlavaProcessor: # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.47.1/src/transformers/models/llava/processing_llava.py#L167-L170 prompt_strings = [] for sample in text: sample = sample.replace(self.image_token, self.image_token * num_image_tokens) prompt_strings.append(sample) It simply repeats each input image_token a number of times equal to the number of placeholder feature tokens (num_image_tokens). Based on this, we override _get_prompt_updates as follows: Code def _get_prompt_updates( self, mm_items: MultiModalDataItems, hf_processor_mm_kwargs: Mapping[str, object], out_mm_kwargs: MultiModalKwargsItems, ) -> Sequence[PromptUpdate]: hf_config = self.info.get_hf_config() image_token_id = hf_config.image_token_index def get_replacement(item_idx: int): images = mm_items.get_items(\"image\", ImageProcessorItems) image_size = images.get_image_size(item_idx) num_image_tokens = self.info.get_num_image_tokens( image_width=image_size.width, image_height=image_size.height, ) return [image_token_id] * num_image_tokens return [ PromptReplacement( modality=\"image\", target=[image_token_id], replacement=get_replacement, ), ] Recall the layout of feature tokens from Step 2: |SPEAKER||SPEAKER|...|SPEAKER||NEWLINE| |SPEAKER||SPEAKER|...|SPEAKER||NEWLINE| ... |SPEAKER||SPEAKER|...|SPEAKER||NEWLINE| We define a helper function to return ncols and nrows directly: Code def get_image_feature_grid_size( self, *, image_width: int, image_height: int, ) -> tuple[int, int]: image_processor = self.get_image_processor() target_width = image_processor.size[\"width\"] target_height = image_processor.size[\"height\"] patch_width = image_processor.patch_size[\"width\"] patch_height = image_processor.patch_size[\"height\"] if not (image_width <= target_width and image_height <= target_height): height_scale_factor = target_height / image_height width_scale_factor = target_width / image_width optimal_scale_factor = min(height_scale_factor, width_scale_factor) image_height = int(image_height * optimal_scale_factor) image_width = int(image_width * optimal_scale_factor) ncols = math.ceil(image_width / patch_width) nrows = math.ceil(image_height / patch_height) return ncols, nrows Based on this, we can initially define our replacement tokens as: Code def get_replacement(item_idx: int): images = mm_items.get_items(\"image\", ImageProcessorItems) image_size = images.get_image_size(item_idx) ncols, nrows = self.info.get_image_feature_grid_size( image_width=image_size.width, image_height=image_size.height, ) # `_IMAGE_TOKEN_ID` corresponds to `|SPEAKER|` # `_NEWLINE_TOKEN_ID` corresponds to `|NEWLINE|` return ([_IMAGE_TOKEN_ID] * ncols + [_NEWLINE_TOKEN_ID]) * nrows However, this is not entirely correct. After FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess_with_tokenizer_info is called, a BOS token (<s>) is also added to the promopt: Code # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.48.3/src/transformers/models/fuyu/processing_fuyu.py#L417-L435 model_image_input = self.image_processor.preprocess_with_tokenizer_info( image_input=tensor_batch_images, image_present=image_present, image_unpadded_h=image_unpadded_heights, image_unpadded_w=image_unpadded_widths, image_placeholder_id=image_placeholder_id, image_newline_id=image_newline_id, variable_sized=True, ) prompt_tokens, prompts_length = _tokenize_prompts_with_image_and_batch( tokenizer=self.tokenizer, prompts=prompts, scale_factors=scale_factors, max_tokens_to_generate=self.max_tokens_to_generate, max_position_embeddings=self.max_position_embeddings, add_BOS=True, add_beginning_of_answer_token=True, ) To assign the vision embeddings to only the image tokens, instead of a string you can return an instance of PromptUpdateDetails: Code hf_config = self.info.get_hf_config() bos_token_id = hf_config.bos_token_id # `<s>` assert isinstance(bos_token_id, int) def get_replacement_fuyu(item_idx: int): images = mm_items.get_items(\"image\", ImageProcessorItems) image_size = images.get_image_size(item_idx) ncols, nrows = self.info.get_image_feature_grid_size( image_width=image_size.width, image_height=image_size.height, ) image_tokens = ([_IMAGE_TOKEN_ID] * ncols + [_NEWLINE_TOKEN_ID]) * nrows return PromptUpdateDetails.select_token_id( image_tokens + [bos_token_id], embed_token_id=_IMAGE_TOKEN_ID, ) Finally, noticing that the HF processor removes the |ENDOFTEXT| token from the tokenized prompt, we can search for it to conduct the replacement at the start of the string: Code def _get_prompt_updates( self, mm_items: MultiModalDataItems, hf_processor_mm_kwargs: Mapping[str, object], out_mm_kwargs: MultiModalKwargsItems, ) -> Sequence[PromptUpdate]: hf_config = self.info.get_hf_config() bos_token_id = hf_config.bos_token_id assert isinstance(bos_token_id, int) tokenizer = self.info.get_tokenizer() eot_token_id = tokenizer.bos_token_id assert isinstance(eot_token_id, int) def get_replacement_fuyu(item_idx: int): images = mm_items.get_items(\"image\", ImageProcessorItems) image_size = images.get_image_size(item_idx) ncols, nrows = self.info.get_image_feature_grid_size( image_width=image_size.width, image_height=image_size.height, ) image_tokens = ([_IMAGE_TOKEN_ID] * ncols + [_NEWLINE_TOKEN_ID]) * nrows return PromptUpdateDetails.select_token_id( image_tokens + [bos_token_id], embed_token_id=_IMAGE_TOKEN_ID, ) return [ PromptReplacement( modality=\"image\", target=[eot_token_id], replacement=get_replacement_fuyu, ) ] 5. Register processor-related classes¶ After you have defined BaseProcessingInfo (Step 2), BaseDummyInputsBuilder (Step 3), and BaseMultiModalProcessor (Step 4), decorate the model class with MULTIMODAL_REGISTRY.register_processor to register them to the multi-modal registry: from vllm.model_executor.models.interfaces import SupportsMultiModal + from vllm.multimodal import MULTIMODAL_REGISTRY + @MULTIMODAL_REGISTRY.register_processor( + YourMultiModalProcessor, + info=YourProcessingInfo, + dummy_inputs=YourDummyInputsBuilder, + ) class YourModelForImage2Seq(nn.Module, SupportsMultiModal): Notes¶ Inserting feature tokens without replacement¶ Some HF processors directly insert feature tokens without replacing anything in the original prompt. In that case, you can use PromptInsertion instead of PromptReplacement inside _get_prompt_updates. Examples: BLIP-2 (insert at start of prompt): vllm/model_executor/models/blip2.py Molmo (insert after <|endoftext|> token): vllm/model_executor/models/molmo.py Handling prompt updates unrelated to multi-modal data¶ _get_prompt_updates assumes that each application of prompt update corresponds to one multi-modal item. If the HF processor performs additional processing regardless of how many multi-modal items there are, you should override _apply_hf_processor_tokens_only so that the processed token inputs are consistent with the result of applying the HF processor on text inputs. This is because token inputs bypass the HF processor according to our design. Examples: Chameleon (appends sep_token): vllm/model_executor/models/chameleon.py Fuyu (appends boa_token): vllm/model_executor/models/fuyu.py Molmo (applies chat template which is not defined elsewhere): vllm/model_executor/models/molmo.py Custom HF processor¶ Some models don't define an HF processor class on HF Hub. In that case, you can define a custom HF processor that has the same call signature as HF processors and pass it to _call_hf_processor. Examples: DeepSeek-VL2: vllm/model_executor/models/deepseek_vl2.py InternVL: vllm/model_executor/models/internvl.py Qwen-VL: vllm/model_executor/models/qwen_vl.py November 13, 2025",

      "description": "Multi-Modal Support¶ This document walks you through the steps to extend a basic model so that it accepts multi-modal inputs. 1. Update the base vLLM model¶ It is assumed that you have already implemented the model in vLLM according to these steps. Further update the model as follows: Implement get_placeholder_str to define the placeholder string which is used to represent the multi-modal item in the text prompt. This should be consistent with the chat template of the model. Code class YourModelForImage2Seq(nn.Module): ... @classmethod def get_placeholder_str(cls, modality: str, i: int) -> str | None: if modality.startswith(\"image\"): return \"<image>\" raise ValueError(\"Only image modality is supported\") Reserve a keyword parameter in forward for each input tensor that corresponds to a multi-modal input, as shown in the following example: def forward( self, input_ids: torch.Tensor, positions: torch.Tensor, + pixel_values: torch.Tensor, ) -> SamplerOutput: More conveniently, you can simply pass **kwargs to the forward method and retrieve the keyword parameters for multimodal inputs from it. Implement embed_multimodal that returns the embeddings from running the multimodal inputs through the multimodal tokenizer of the model. Below we provide a boilerplate of a typical implementation pattern, but feel free to adjust it to your own needs. Code class YourModelForImage2Seq(nn.Module): ... def _process_image_input(self, image_input: YourModelImageInputs) -> torch.Tensor: assert self.vision_encoder is not None image_features = self.vision_encoder(image_input) return self.multi_modal_projector(image_features) def embed_multimodal( self, **kwargs: object, ) -> MultiModalEmbeddings | None: # Validate the multimodal input keyword arguments image_input = self._parse_and_validate_image_input(**kwargs) if image_input is None: return None # Run multimodal inputs through encoder and projector vision_embeddings = self._process_image_input(image_input) return vision_embeddings Important The returned multimodal_embeddings must be either a 3D torch.Tensor of shape (num_items, feature_size, hidden_size), or a list / tuple of 2D torch.Tensor's of shape (feature_size, hidden_size), so that multimodal_embeddings[i] retrieves the embeddings generated from the i-th multimodal data item (e.g, image) of the request. Note By default, vLLM merges the multimodal embeddings into text embeddings depending on the information of their locations defined in PlaceholderRange from input processing. This logic can be found at embed_input_ids. You may override this method if additional logic is required for your model when merging embeddings. Implement get_language_model getter to provide stable access to the underlying language model. class YourModelForImage2Seq(nn.Module): ... def get_language_model(self) -> torch.nn.Module: # Change `language_model` according to your implementation. return self.language_model Once the above steps are done, update the model class with the SupportsMultiModal interface. + from vllm.model_executor.models.interfaces import SupportsMultiModal - class YourModelForImage2Seq(nn.Module): + class YourModelForImage2Seq(nn.Module, SupportsMultiModal): Note The model class does not have to be named *ForCausalLM. Check out the HuggingFace Transformers documentation for some examples. 2. Specify processing information¶ Next, create a subclass of BaseProcessingInfo to provide basic information related to HF processing. Maximum number of input items¶ You need to override the abstract method get_supported_mm_limits to return the maximum number of input items for each modality supported by the model. For example, if the model supports any number of images but only one video per prompt: def get_supported_mm_limits(self) -> Mapping[str, int | None]: return {\"image\": None, \"video\": 1} 3. Specify dummy inputs¶ Then, inherit BaseDummyInputsBuilder to construct dummy inputs for HF processing as well as memory profiling. For memory profiling¶ Override the abstract methods get_dummy_text and get_dummy_mm_data to construct dummy inputs for memory profiling. These dummy inputs should result in the worst-case memory usage of the model so that vLLM can reserve the correct amount of memory for it. Assuming that the memory usage increases with the number of tokens, the dummy inputs can be constructed to maximize the number of output embeddings, which is the same number as placeholder feature tokens. Basic example: LLaVANo input placeholders: Fuyu Looking at the code of HF's LlavaForConditionalGeneration: Code # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.47.1/src/transformers/models/llava/modeling_llava.py#L530-L544 n_image_tokens = (input_ids == self.config.image_token_index).sum().item() n_image_features = image_features.shape[0] * image_features.shape[1] if n_image_tokens != n_image_features: raise ValueError( f\"Image features and image tokens do not match: tokens: {n_image_tokens}, features {n_image_features}\" ) special_image_mask = ( (input_ids == self.config.image_token_index) .unsqueeze(-1) .expand_as(inputs_embeds) .to(inputs_embeds.device) ) image_features = image_features.to(inputs_embeds.device, inputs_embeds.dtype) inputs_embeds = inputs_embeds.masked_scatter(special_image_mask, image_features) The number of placeholder feature tokens per image is image_features.shape[1]. image_features is calculated inside the get_image_features method: Code # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.47.1/src/transformers/models/llava/modeling_llava.py#L290-L300 image_outputs = self.vision_tower(pixel_values, output_hidden_states=True) selected_image_feature = image_outputs.hidden_states[vision_feature_layer] if vision_feature_select_strategy == \"default\": selected_image_feature = selected_image_feature[:, 1:] elif vision_feature_select_strategy == \"full\": selected_image_feature = selected_image_feature else: raise ValueError(f\"Unexpected select feature strategy: {self.config.vision_feature_select_strategy}\") image_features = self.multi_modal_projector(selected_image_feature) return image_features We can infer that image_features.shape[1] is based on image_outputs.hidden_states.shape[1] from the vision tower (CLIPVisionModel for the llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf model). Moreover, we only need the sequence length (the second dimension of the tensor) to get image_features.shape[1]. The sequence length is determined by the initial hidden states in CLIPVisionTransformer since the attention mechanism doesn't change the sequence length of the output hidden states. # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.47.1/src/transformers/models/clip/modeling_clip.py#L1094-L1102 hidden_states = self.embeddings(pixel_values, interpolate_pos_encoding=interpolate_pos_encoding) hidden_states = self.pre_layrnorm(hidden_states) encoder_outputs = self.encoder( inputs_embeds=hidden_states, output_attentions=output_attentions, output_hidden_states=output_hidden_states, return_dict=return_dict, ) To find the sequence length, we turn to the code of CLIPVisionEmbeddings: Code # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.47.1/src/transformers/models/clip/modeling_clip.py#L247-L257 target_dtype = self.patch_embedding.weight.dtype patch_embeds = self.patch_embedding(pixel_values.to(dtype=target_dtype)) # shape = [*, width, grid, grid] patch_embeds = patch_embeds.flatten(2).transpose(1, 2) class_embeds = self.class_embedding.expand(batch_size, 1, -1) embeddings = torch.cat([class_embeds, patch_embeds], dim=1) if interpolate_pos_encoding: embeddings = embeddings + self.interpolate_pos_encoding(embeddings, height, width) else: embeddings = embeddings + self.position_embedding(self.position_ids) return embeddings We can infer that embeddings.shape[1] == self.num_positions, where # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.47.1/src/transformers/models/clip/modeling_clip.py#L195-L196 self.num_patches = (self.image_size // self.patch_size) ** 2 self.num_positions = self.num_patches + 1 Overall, the number of placeholder feature tokens for an image can be calculated as: Code def get_num_image_tokens( self, *, image_width: int, image_height: int, ) -> int: hf_config = self.get_hf_config() hf_processor = self.get_hf_processor() image_size = hf_config.vision_config.image_size patch_size = hf_config.vision_config.patch_size num_image_tokens = (image_size // patch_size) ** 2 + 1 if hf_processor.vision_feature_select_strategy == \"default\": num_image_tokens -= 1 return num_image_tokens Notice that the number of image tokens doesn't depend on the image width and height. We can simply use a dummy image_size to calculate the multimodal profiling data: Code # NOTE: In actuality, this is usually implemented as part of the # model's subclass of `BaseProcessingInfo`, but we show it as is # here for simplicity. def get_image_size_with_most_features(self) -> ImageSize: hf_config = self.get_hf_config() width = height = hf_config.image_size return ImageSize(width=width, height=height) def get_dummy_mm_data( self, seq_len: int, mm_counts: Mapping[str, int], mm_options: Mapping[str, BaseDummyOptions] | None = None, ) -> MultiModalDataDict: num_images = mm_counts.get(\"image\", 0) target_width, target_height = \\ self.info.get_image_size_with_most_features() image_overrides = mm_options.get(\"image\") if mm_options else None return { \"image\": self._get_dummy_images(width=target_width, height=target_height, num_images=num_images, overrides=image_overrides) } For the text, we simply expand the multimodal image token from the model config to match the desired number of images. def get_dummy_text(self, mm_counts: Mapping[str, int]) -> str: num_images = mm_counts.get(\"image\", 0) processor = self.info.get_hf_processor() image_token = processor.image_token return image_token * num_images Looking at the code of HF's FuyuForCausalLM: Code # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.48.3/src/transformers/models/fuyu/modeling_fuyu.py#L311-L322 if image_patches is not None and past_key_values is None: patch_embeddings = [ self.vision_embed_tokens(patch.to(self.vision_embed_tokens.weight.dtype)) .squeeze(0) .to(inputs_embeds.device) for patch in image_patches ] inputs_embeds = self.gather_continuous_embeddings( word_embeddings=inputs_embeds, continuous_embeddings=patch_embeddings, image_patch_input_indices=image_patches_indices, ) The number of placeholder feature tokens for the ith item in the batch is patch_embeddings[i].shape[0], which is the same as image_patches[i].shape[0], i.e. num_total_patches. Unlike LLaVA, Fuyu does not define the number of patches inside the modeling file. Where can we get more information? Considering that the model input comes from the output of FuyuProcessor, let's look at the preprocessing files. The image outputs are obtained by calling FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess and then FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess_with_tokenizer_info inside FuyuProcessor. In FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess, the images are resized and padded to the target FuyuImageProcessor.size, returning the dimensions after resizing (but before padding) as metadata. Code # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.48.3/src/transformers/models/fuyu/processing_fuyu.py#L541-L544 image_encoding = self.image_processor.preprocess(images, **output_kwargs[\"images_kwargs\"]) batch_images = image_encoding[\"images\"] image_unpadded_heights = image_encoding[\"image_unpadded_heights\"] image_unpadded_widths = image_encoding[\"image_unpadded_widths\"] # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.48.3/src/transformers/models/fuyu/image_processing_fuyu.py#L480-L if do_resize: batch_images = [ [self.resize(image, size=size, input_data_format=input_data_format) for image in images] for images in batch_images ] image_sizes = [get_image_size(images[0], channel_dim=input_data_format) for images in batch_images] image_unpadded_heights = [[image_size[0]] for image_size in image_sizes] image_unpadded_widths = [[image_size[1]] for image_size in image_sizes] if do_pad: batch_images = [ [ self.pad_image( image, size=size, mode=padding_mode, constant_values=padding_value, input_data_format=input_data_format, ) for image in images ] for images in batch_images ] In FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess_with_tokenizer_info, the images are split into patches based on this metadata: Code # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.48.3/src/transformers/models/fuyu/processing_fuyu.py#L417-L425 model_image_input = self.image_processor.preprocess_with_tokenizer_info( image_input=tensor_batch_images, image_present=image_present, image_unpadded_h=image_unpadded_heights, image_unpadded_w=image_unpadded_widths, image_placeholder_id=image_placeholder_id, image_newline_id=image_newline_id, variable_sized=True, ) # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.48.3/src/transformers/models/fuyu/image_processing_fuyu.py#L638-L658 image_height, image_width = image.shape[1], image.shape[2] if variable_sized: # variable_sized=True new_h = min( image_height, math.ceil(image_unpadded_h[batch_index, subseq_index] / patch_height) * patch_height, ) new_w = min( image_width, math.ceil(image_unpadded_w[batch_index, subseq_index] / patch_width) * patch_width, ) image = image[:, :new_h, :new_w] image_height, image_width = new_h, new_w num_patches = self.get_num_patches(image_height=image_height, image_width=image_width) tensor_of_image_ids = torch.full( [num_patches], image_placeholder_id, dtype=torch.int32, device=image_input.device ) patches = self.patchify_image(image=image.unsqueeze(0)).squeeze(0) assert num_patches == patches.shape[0] The number of patches is in turn defined by FuyuImageProcessor.get_num_patches: Code # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.48.3/src/transformers/models/fuyu/image_processing_fuyu.py#L552-L562 patch_size = patch_size if patch_size is not None else self.patch_size patch_height, patch_width = self.patch_size[\"height\"], self.patch_size[\"width\"] if image_height % patch_height != 0: raise ValueError(f\"{image_height=} must be divisible by {patch_height}\") if image_width % patch_width != 0: raise ValueError(f\"{image_width=} must be divisible by {patch_width}\") num_patches_per_dim_h = image_height // patch_height num_patches_per_dim_w = image_width // patch_width num_patches = num_patches_per_dim_h * num_patches_per_dim_w These image patches correspond to placeholder tokens (|SPEAKER|). So, we just need to maximize the number of image patches. Since input images are first resized to fit within image_processor.size, we can maximize the number of image patches by inputting an image with size equal to image_processor.size. def get_image_size_with_most_features(self) -> ImageSize: image_processor = self.get_image_processor() return ImageSize( width=image_processor.size[\"width\"], height=image_processor.size[\"height\"], ) Fuyu does not expect image placeholders in the inputs to HF processor, so the dummy prompt text is empty regardless of the number of images. def get_dummy_text(self, mm_counts: Mapping[str, int]) -> str: return \"\" For the multimodal image profiling data, the logic is very similar to LLaVA: Code def get_dummy_mm_data( self, seq_len: int, mm_counts: Mapping[str, int], mm_options: Optional[Mapping[str, BaseDummyOptions]] = None, ) -> MultiModalDataDict: target_width, target_height = \\ self.info.get_image_size_with_most_features() num_images = mm_counts.get(\"image\", 0) image_overrides = mm_options.get(\"image\") if mm_options else None return { \"image\": self._get_dummy_images( width=target_width, height=target_height, num_images=num_images, overrides=image_overrides, ) } 4. Specify processing details¶ Afterwards, create a subclass of BaseMultiModalProcessor to fill in the missing details about HF processing. Info Multi-Modal Data Processing Multi-modal fields¶ Override _get_mm_fields_config to return a schema of the tensors outputted by the HF processor that are related to the input multi-modal items. Basic example: LLaVAWith postprocessing: Fuyu The output of CLIPImageProcessor is a simple tensor with shape (num_images, num_channels, image_height, image_width): # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.47.1/src/transformers/models/clip/image_processing_clip.py#L339-L345 images = [ to_channel_dimension_format(image, data_format, input_channel_dim=input_data_format) for image in all_images ] data = {\"pixel_values\": images} return BatchFeature(data=data, tensor_type=return_tensors) So, we override _get_mm_fields_config as follows: def _get_mm_fields_config( self, hf_inputs: BatchFeature, hf_processor_mm_kwargs: Mapping[str, object], ) -> Mapping[str, MultiModalFieldConfig]: return dict( pixel_values=MultiModalFieldConfig.batched(\"image\"), ) Note Our actual code additionally supports pre-computed image embeddings, which can be passed to be model via the image_embeds argument. The image_patches output of FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess_with_tokenizer_info concatenates the patches from each image belonging to an item in the batch: # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.48.3/src/transformers/models/fuyu/image_processing_fuyu.py#L673-L679 image_input_ids.append(tensor_of_image_ids) image_patches.append(patches) else: image_input_ids.append(torch.tensor([], dtype=torch.int32, device=image_input.device)) batch_image_input_ids.append(image_input_ids) batch_image_patches.append(image_patches) The shape of image_patches outputted by FuyuImageProcessor is therefore (1, num_images, num_patches, patch_width * patch_height * num_channels). In order to support the use of MultiModalFieldConfig.batched like in LLaVA, we remove the extra batch dimension by overriding BaseMultiModalProcessor._call_hf_processor: Code def _call_hf_processor( self, prompt: str, mm_data: Mapping[str, object], mm_kwargs: Mapping[str, object], tok_kwargs: Mapping[str, object], ) -> BatchFeature: processed_outputs = super()._call_hf_processor( prompt=prompt, mm_data=mm_data, mm_kwargs=mm_kwargs, tok_kwargs=tok_kwargs, ) image_patches = processed_outputs.get(\"image_patches\") if image_patches is not None: images = mm_data[\"images\"] assert isinstance(images, list) # Original output: (1, num_images, Pn, Px * Py * C) # New output: (num_images, Pn, Px * Py * C) assert (isinstance(image_patches, list) and len(image_patches) == 1) assert (isinstance(image_patches[0], torch.Tensor) and len(image_patches[0]) == len(images)) processed_outputs[\"image_patches\"] = image_patches[0] return processed_outputs Note Our actual code has special handling for text-only inputs to prevent unnecessary warnings from HF processor. Note The _call_hf_processor method specifies both mm_kwargs and tok_kwargs for processing. mm_kwargs is used to both initialize and call the huggingface processor, whereas tok_kwargs is only used to call the huggingface processor. This lets us override _get_mm_fields_config as follows: def _get_mm_fields_config( self, hf_inputs: BatchFeature, hf_processor_mm_kwargs: Mapping[str, object], ) -> Mapping[str, MultiModalFieldConfig]: return dict(image_patches=MultiModalFieldConfig.batched(\"image\")) Prompt updates¶ Override _get_prompt_updates to return a list of PromptUpdate instances. Each PromptUpdate instance specifies an update operation (e.g.: insertion, replacement) performed by the HF processor. Basic example: LLaVAHandling additional tokens: Fuyu Looking at HF's LlavaProcessor: # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.47.1/src/transformers/models/llava/processing_llava.py#L167-L170 prompt_strings = [] for sample in text: sample = sample.replace(self.image_token, self.image_token * num_image_tokens) prompt_strings.append(sample) It simply repeats each input image_token a number of times equal to the number of placeholder feature tokens (num_image_tokens). Based on this, we override _get_prompt_updates as follows: Code def _get_prompt_updates( self, mm_items: MultiModalDataItems, hf_processor_mm_kwargs: Mapping[str, object], out_mm_kwargs: MultiModalKwargsItems, ) -> Sequence[PromptUpdate]: hf_config = self.info.get_hf_config() image_token_id = hf_config.image_token_index def get_replacement(item_idx: int): images = mm_items.get_items(\"image\", ImageProcessorItems) image_size = images.get_image_size(item_idx) num_image_tokens = self.info.get_num_image_tokens( image_width=image_size.width, image_height=image_size.height, ) return [image_token_id] * num_image_tokens return [ PromptReplacement( modality=\"image\", target=[image_token_id], replacement=get_replacement, ), ] Recall the layout of feature tokens from Step 2: |SPEAKER||SPEAKER|...|SPEAKER||NEWLINE| |SPEAKER||SPEAKER|...|SPEAKER||NEWLINE| ... |SPEAKER||SPEAKER|...|SPEAKER||NEWLINE| We define a helper function to return ncols and nrows directly: Code def get_image_feature_grid_size( self, *, image_width: int, image_height: int, ) -> tuple[int, int]: image_processor = self.get_image_processor() target_width = image_processor.size[\"width\"] target_height = image_processor.size[\"height\"] patch_width = image_processor.patch_size[\"width\"] patch_height = image_processor.patch_size[\"height\"] if not (image_width <= target_width and image_height <= target_height): height_scale_factor = target_height / image_height width_scale_factor = target_width / image_width optimal_scale_factor = min(height_scale_factor, width_scale_factor) image_height = int(image_height * optimal_scale_factor) image_width = int(image_width * optimal_scale_factor) ncols = math.ceil(image_width / patch_width) nrows = math.ceil(image_height / patch_height) return ncols, nrows Based on this, we can initially define our replacement tokens as: Code def get_replacement(item_idx: int): images = mm_items.get_items(\"image\", ImageProcessorItems) image_size = images.get_image_size(item_idx) ncols, nrows = self.info.get_image_feature_grid_size( image_width=image_size.width, image_height=image_size.height, ) # `_IMAGE_TOKEN_ID` corresponds to `|SPEAKER|` # `_NEWLINE_TOKEN_ID` corresponds to `|NEWLINE|` return ([_IMAGE_TOKEN_ID] * ncols + [_NEWLINE_TOKEN_ID]) * nrows However, this is not entirely correct. After FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess_with_tokenizer_info is called, a BOS token (<s>) is also added to the promopt: Code # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.48.3/src/transformers/models/fuyu/processing_fuyu.py#L417-L435 model_image_input = self.image_processor.preprocess_with_tokenizer_info( image_input=tensor_batch_images, image_present=image_present, image_unpadded_h=image_unpadded_heights, image_unpadded_w=image_unpadded_widths, image_placeholder_id=image_placeholder_id, image_newline_id=image_newline_id, variable_sized=True, ) prompt_tokens, prompts_length = _tokenize_prompts_with_image_and_batch( tokenizer=self.tokenizer, prompts=prompts, scale_factors=scale_factors, max_tokens_to_generate=self.max_tokens_to_generate, max_position_embeddings=self.max_position_embeddings, add_BOS=True, add_beginning_of_answer_token=True, ) To assign the vision embeddings to only the image tokens, instead of a string you can return an instance of PromptUpdateDetails: Code hf_config = self.info.get_hf_config() bos_token_id = hf_config.bos_token_id # `<s>` assert isinstance(bos_token_id, int) def get_replacement_fuyu(item_idx: int): images = mm_items.get_items(\"image\", ImageProcessorItems) image_size = images.get_image_size(item_idx) ncols, nrows = self.info.get_image_feature_grid_size( image_width=image_size.width, image_height=image_size.height, ) image_tokens = ([_IMAGE_TOKEN_ID] * ncols + [_NEWLINE_TOKEN_ID]) * nrows return PromptUpdateDetails.select_token_id( image_tokens + [bos_token_id], embed_token_id=_IMAGE_TOKEN_ID, ) Finally, noticing that the HF processor removes the |ENDOFTEXT| token from the tokenized prompt, we can search for it to conduct the replacement at the start of the string: Code def _get_prompt_updates( self, mm_items: MultiModalDataItems, hf_processor_mm_kwargs: Mapping[str, object], out_mm_kwargs: MultiModalKwargsItems, ) -> Sequence[PromptUpdate]: hf_config = self.info.get_hf_config() bos_token_id = hf_config.bos_token_id assert isinstance(bos_token_id, int) tokenizer = self.info.get_tokenizer() eot_token_id = tokenizer.bos_token_id assert isinstance(eot_token_id, int) def get_replacement_fuyu(item_idx: int): images = mm_items.get_items(\"image\", ImageProcessorItems) image_size = images.get_image_size(item_idx) ncols, nrows = self.info.get_image_feature_grid_size( image_width=image_size.width, image_height=image_size.height, ) image_tokens = ([_IMAGE_TOKEN_ID] * ncols + [_NEWLINE_TOKEN_ID]) * nrows return PromptUpdateDetails.select_token_id( image_tokens + [bos_token_id], embed_token_id=_IMAGE_TOKEN_ID, ) return [ PromptReplacement( modality=\"image\", target=[eot_token_id], replacement=get_replacement_fuyu, ) ] 5. Register processor-related classes¶ After you have defined BaseProcessingInfo (Step 2), BaseDummyInputsBuilder (Step 3), and BaseMultiModalProcessor (Step 4), decorate the model class with MULTIMODAL_REGISTRY.register_processor to register them to the multi-modal registry: from vllm.model_executor.models.interfaces import SupportsMultiModal + from vllm.multimodal import MULTIMODAL_REGISTRY + @MULTIMODAL_REGISTRY.register_processor( + YourMultiModalProcessor, + info=YourProcessingInfo, + dummy_inputs=YourDummyInputsBuilder, + ) class YourModelForImage2Seq(nn.Module, SupportsMultiModal): Notes¶ Inserting feature tokens without replacement¶ Some HF processors directly insert feature tokens without replacing anything in the original prompt. In that case, you can use PromptInsertion instead of PromptReplacement inside _get_prompt_updates. Examples: BLIP-2 (insert at start of prompt): vllm/model_executor/models/blip2.py Molmo (insert after <|endoftext|> token): vllm/model_executor/models/molmo.py Handling prompt updates unrelated to multi-modal data¶ _get_prompt_updates assumes that each application of prompt update corresponds to one multi-modal item. If the HF processor performs additional processing regardless of how many multi-modal items there are, you should override _apply_hf_processor_tokens_only so that the processed token inputs are consistent with the result of applying the HF processor on text inputs. This is because token inputs bypass the HF processor according to our design. Examples: Chameleon (appends sep_token): vllm/model_executor/models/chameleon.py Fuyu (appends boa_token): vllm/model_executor/models/fuyu.py Molmo (applies chat template which is not defined elsewhere): vllm/model_executor/models/molmo.py Custom HF processor¶ Some models don't define an HF processor class on HF Hub. In that case, you can define a custom HF processor that has the same call signature as HF processors and pass it to _call_hf_processor. Examples: DeepSeek-VL2: vllm/model_executor/models/deepseek_vl2.py InternVL: vllm/model_executor/models/internvl.py Qwen-VL: vllm/model_executor/models/qwen_vl.py November 13, 2025",

Moreover, we only need the sequence length (the second dimension of the tensor) to get image_features.shape[1]. The sequence length is determined by the initial hidden states in CLIPVisionTransformer since the attention mechanism doesn't change the sequence length of the output hidden states. # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.47.1/src/transformers/models/clip/modeling_clip.py#L1094-L1102 hidden_states = self.embeddings(pixel_values, interpolate_pos_encoding=interpolate_pos_encoding) hidden_states = self.pre_layrnorm(hidden_states) encoder_outputs = self.encoder( inputs_embeds=hidden_states, output_attentions=output_attentions, output_hidden_states=output_hidden_states, return_dict=return_dict, ) To find the sequence length, we turn to the code of CLIPVisionEmbeddings: Code # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.47.1/src/transformers/models/clip/modeling_clip.py#L247-L257 target_dtype = self.patch_embedding.weight.dtype patch_embeds = self.patch_embedding(pixel_values.to(dtype=target_dtype)) # shape = [*, width, grid, grid] patch_embeds = patch_embeds.flatten(2).transpose(1, 2) class_embeds = self.class_embedding.expand(batch_size, 1, -1) embeddings = torch.cat([class_embeds, patch_embeds], dim=1) if interpolate_pos_encoding: embeddings = embeddings + self.interpolate_pos_encoding(embeddings, height, width) else: embeddings = embeddings + self.position_embedding(self.position_ids) return embeddings We can infer that embeddings.shape[1] == self.num_positions, where # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.47.1/src/transformers/models/clip/modeling_clip.py#L195-L196 self.num_patches = (self.image_size // self.patch_size) ** 2 self.num_positions = self.num_patches + 1 Overall, the number of placeholder feature tokens for an image can be calculated as: Code def get_num_image_tokens( self, *, image_width: int, image_height: int, ) -> int: hf_config = self.get_hf_config() hf_processor = self.get_hf_processor() image_size = hf_config.vision_config.image_size patch_size = hf_config.vision_config.patch_size num_image_tokens = (image_size // patch_size) ** 2 + 1 if hf_processor.vision_feature_select_strategy == \"default\": num_image_tokens -= 1 return num_image_tokens Notice that the number of image tokens doesn't depend on the image width and height. We can simply use a dummy image_size to calculate the multimodal profiling data: Code # NOTE: In actuality, this is usually implemented as part of the # model's subclass of `BaseProcessingInfo`, but we show it as is # here for simplicity. def get_image_size_with_most_features(self) -> ImageSize: hf_config = self.get_hf_config() width = height = hf_config.image_size return ImageSize(width=width, height=height) def get_dummy_mm_data( self, seq_len: int, mm_counts: Mapping[str, int], mm_options: Mapping[str, BaseDummyOptions] | None = None, ) -> MultiModalDataDict: num_images = mm_counts.get(\"image\", 0) target_width, target_height = \\ self.info.get_image_size_with_most_features() image_overrides = mm_options.get(\"image\") if mm_options else None return { \"image\": self._get_dummy_images(width=target_width, height=target_height, num_images=num_images, overrides=image_overrides) } For the text, we simply expand the multimodal image token from the model config to match the desired number of images. def get_dummy_text(self, mm_counts: Mapping[str, int]) -> str: num_images = mm_counts.get(\"image\", 0) processor = self.info.get_hf_processor() image_token = processor.image_token return image_token * num_images Looking at the code of HF's FuyuForCausalLM: Code # https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.48.3/src/transformers/models/fuyu/modeling_fuyu.py#L311-L322 if image_patches is not None and past_key_values is None: patch_embeddings = [ self.vision_embed_tokens(patch.to(self.vision_embed_tokens.weight.dtype)) .squeeze(0) .to(inputs_embeds.device) for patch in image_patches ] inputs_embeds = self.gather_continuous_embeddings( word_embeddings=inputs_embeds, continuous_embeddings=patch_embeddings, image_patch_input_indices=image_patches_indices, ) The number of placeholder feature tokens for the ith item in the batch is patch_embeddings[i].shape[0], which is the same as image_patches[i].shape[0], i.e. num_total_patches. Unlike LLaVA, Fuyu does not define the number of patches inside the modeling file. Where can we get more information? Considering that the model input comes from the output of FuyuProcessor, let's look at the preprocessing files. The image outputs are obtained by calling FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess and then FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess_with_tokenizer_info inside FuyuProcessor. In FuyuImageProcessor.preprocess, the images are resized and padded to the target FuyuImageProcessor.size, returning the dimensions after resizing (but before padding) as metadata.

So, we just need to maximize the number of image patches. Since input images are first resized to fit within image_processor.size, we can maximize the number of image patches by inputting an image with size equal to image_processor.size. def get_image_size_with_most_features(self) -> ImageSize: image_processor = self.get_image_processor() return ImageSize( width=image_processor.size[\"width\"], height=image_processor.size[\"height\"], ) Fuyu does not expect image placeholders in the inputs to HF processor, so the dummy prompt text is empty regardless of the number of images. def get_dummy_text(self, mm_counts: Mapping[str, int]) -> str: return \"\" For the multimodal image profiling data, the logic is very similar to LLaVA: Code def get_dummy_mm_data( self, seq_len: int, mm_counts: Mapping[str, int], mm_options: Optional[Mapping[str, BaseDummyOptions]] = None, ) -> MultiModalDataDict: target_width, target_height = \\ self.info.get_image_size_with_most_features() num_images = mm_counts.get(\"image\", 0) image_overrides = mm_options.get(\"image\") if mm_options else None return { \"image\": self._get_dummy_images( width=target_width, height=target_height, num_images=num_images, overrides=image_overrides, ) }",
