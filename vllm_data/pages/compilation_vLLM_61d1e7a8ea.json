  "content": "Constants for the cudagraph mode in CompilationConfig. Meanwhile, the subset enum NONE, PIECEWISE and FULL are also treated as concrete runtime mode for cudagraph runtime dispatching.\n\nConfiguration for compilation.\n\nYou must pass CompilationConfig to VLLMConfig constructor. VLLMConfig's post_init does further initialization. If used outside of the VLLMConfig, some fields will be left in an improper state.\n\nWhy we have different sizes for cudagraph and inductor: - cudagraph: a cudagraph captured for a specific size can only be used for the same size. We need to capture all the sizes we want to use. - inductor: a graph compiled by inductor for a general shape can be used for different sizes. Inductor can also compile for specific sizes, where it can have more information to optimize the graph with fully static shapes. However, we find the general shape compilation is sufficient for most cases. It might be beneficial to compile for certain small batchsizes, where inductor is good at optimizing.\n\nThe backend for compilation. It needs to be a string:\n\nbackend function. We use string to avoid serialization issues when using compilation in a distributed setting. When the compilation mode is 1 or 2, the backend is used for the compilation directly (it sees the whole graph). When the compilation mode is 3, the backend supports both whole graph and piecewise compilation, available backends include eager, inductor, and custom backends, the latter of which can be defined via get_compile_backend. Furthermore, compilation is only piecewise if splitting ops is set accordingly and use_inductor_graph_partition is off. Note that the default options for splitting ops are sufficient for piecewise compilation.\n\noptimization: Intuitively, bs_to_padded_graph_size should be dict[int, int]. since we know all keys are in a range [0, max_cudagraph_capture_size], we can optimize it to list[int] for better lookup performance.\n\nThe directory to store the compiled graph, to accelerate Inductor compilation. By default, it will use model-related information to generate a cache directory.\n\ntime taken for compilation\n\nFormat for saving torch compile cache:\n\n\"binary\": saves as binary file (multiprocess safe)\n\n\"unpacked\": saves as directory structure for inspection/debugging (NOT multiprocess safe)\n\nDefaults to VLLM_COMPILE_CACHE_SAVE_FORMAT if not specified.\n\nWhether or not to compile the multimodal encoder. Currently, this only works for Qwen2_5_vl on selected platforms. Disabled by default until more models are supported/tested to work.\n\nSplit points that represent compile ranges for inductor. The compile ranges are [1, split_points[0]], [split_points[0] + 1, split_points[1]], ..., [split_points[-1] + 1, max_num_batched_tokens]. Compile sizes are also used single element ranges, the range is represented as [compile_sizes[i], compile_sizes[i]].\n\nIf a range overlaps with the compile size, graph for compile size will be prioritized, i.e. if we have a range [1, 8] and a compile size 4, graph for compile size 4 will be compiled and used instead of the graph for range [1, 8].\n\nSizes to compile for inductor. In addition to integers, it also supports \"cudagraph_capture_sizes\" to specify the sizes for cudagraph capture.\n\nSizes to capture cudagraph. - None (default): capture sizes are inferred from vllm config. - list[int]: capture sizes are specified as given.\n\nWhether to copy input tensors for cudagraph. If the caller can guarantee that the same input buffers are always used, it can set this to False. Otherwise, it should set this to True, and the compiler will copy the input to an internally managed buffer. Default is False. Note that this flag is only effective when cudagraph_mode is PIECEWISE.\n\nThe mode of the cudagraph:\n\nPIECEWISE mode build piecewise cudagraph only, keeping the cudagraph incompatible ops (i.e. some attention ops) outside the cudagraph for general flexibility.\n\nFULL mode: Capture full cudagraph for all batches. Can be good for small models or workloads with small prompts; not supported by many backends. Generally for performance FULL_AND_PIECEWISE is better.\n\nFULL_DECODE_ONLY mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches only. Mixed prefill-decode batches are run without cudagraphs. Can be good for decode instances in a P/D setup where prefill is not as important so we can save some memory.\n\nFULL_AND_PIECEWISE mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches and piecewise cudagraph for prefill and mixed prefill-decode batches. This is the most performant mode for most models and is the default.\n\nCurrently, the cudagraph mode is only used for the v1 engine. Note that the cudagraph logic is generally orthogonal to the compilation logic. While piecewise cudagraphs require piecewise compilation (mode=VLLM_COMPILE and non-empty splitting_ops), full cudagraphs are supported with and without compilation.\n\nWarning: This flag is new and subject to change in addition more modes may be added.\n\nNumber of warmup runs for cudagraph. It means the first several runs will be treated as warmup runs. Only after that, the execution will be recorded, and the recorded cudagraph will be used for subsequent runs.\n\nWhether to create separate cuda graphs for cases with and without active LoRA adapters. When set to False, the LoRA-enabled cuda graph will be used for all cases, incurring the overhead of running LoRA ops even when no adapters are active. Setting this to True will remove this overhead at the cost of increased startup time and slightly higher memory usage. When enable_lora is False, this option has no effect.\n\nFine-grained control over which custom ops to enable/disable. Use 'all' to enable all, 'none' to disable all. Also specify a list of custom op names to enable (prefixed with a '+'), or disable (prefixed with a '-'). Examples:\n\nBy default, all custom ops are enabled when running without Inductor and disabled when running with Inductor: mode>=VLLM_COMPILE and backend=\"inductor\". Inductor generates (fused) Triton kernels for disabled custom ops.\n\nThe path to dump the debug information.\n\ncustom ops that are disabled\n\nConfiguration for dynamic shapes options\n\ncustom ops that are enabled\n\nAdditional configurations for inductor. - None: use default configurations.\n\nAdditional passes for inductor. It is a dictionary from pass name to pass function qualified name. We use function name because the config uses JSON format. If we pass the config from Python, functions can also be passed directly via Python object constructor, e.g. CompilationConfig(inductor_passes={\"a\": func}).\n\nLevel is deprecated and will be removed in the next release, either 0.12.0 or 0.11.2 whichever is soonest. Please use mode. Currently all levels are mapped to mode.\n\nlocal cache dir for each rank\n\nThe maximum cudagraph capture size.\n\nIf cudagraph_capture_sizes is specified, this will be set to the largest size in that list (or checked for consistency if specified). If cudagraph_capture_sizes is not specified, the list of sizes is generated automatically following the pattern:\n\nIf not specified, max_cudagraph_capture_size is set to min(max_num_seqs*2, 512) by default. This voids OOM in tight memory scenarios with small max_num_seqs, and prevents capture of many large graphs (>512) that would greatly increase startup time with limited performance benefit.\n\nThe compilation approach used for torch.compile-based compilation of the model.\n\nCustom inductor passes, see PassConfig for more details\n\nA list of ops to exclude from cudagraphs, used in piecewise compilation.\n\nThe behavior depends on use_inductor_graph_partition:\n\nWhen use_inductor_graph_partition=False (default): These ops are used for Dynamo FX-level graph splitting. The graph is split at these ops before Inductor compilation, creating separate subgraphs for cudagraph capture.\n\nWhen use_inductor_graph_partition=True: These ops are used to register Inductor partition rules. The graph partitioning happens at Inductor codegen time after all passes and fusions are finished, allowing compilation and custom passes to operate on the full graph while still excluding these ops from cudagraphs.\n\nIf None, defaults to attention ops for piecewise cudagraphs. If empty list [], no ops are excluded (suitable for full cudagraphs).\n\nPer-model forward context Map from layer name to layer objects that need to be accessed outside model code, e.g., Attention, FusedMOE when dp_size>1.\n\nfiles that are traced for compilation\n\nUse inductor graph partition to split the graph at cudagraph_unsafe ops. This partition happens at inductor codegen time after all passes and fusions are finished. It generates a single call function which wraps cudagraph-safe ops into partition functions and leave cudagraph-unsafe ops outside the partition functions. For a graph with N cudagraph-unsafe ops (e.g., Attention), there would be N+1 partitions. To mark an op as cudagraph unsafe, we can add tags=(torch._C.Tag.cudagraph_unsafe) when register the custom op.\n\nThis config supports both full cudagraph and piecewise cudagraph without compiling twice. For piecewise cudagraph, it applies vLLM CUDAGraph wrapper to each partition. For N+1 partitions, there would be N+1 CUDAGraph wrapper instances.\n\nFor full CUDAGraph, we always apply a single CUDAGraph wrapper outside the inductor call function in the model runner. The top-level full cudagraph capture ignores all partitioning.\n\nSkip validation if the value is None when initialisation is delayed.\n\nProvide a hash that uniquely identifies all the configs that affect the structure of the computation graph from input ids/embeddings to the final hidden states, excluding anything before input ids/embeddings and after the final hidden states.\n\nThis method logs the enabled/disabled custom ops and checks that the passed custom_ops field only contains relevant ops. It is called at the end of set_current_vllm_config, after the custom ops have been instantiated.\n\nGet the compile ranges for the compilation config.\n\nInitialize the backend for the compilation config from a vllm config. Arguments: vllm_config: The vllm config to initialize the backend from. Returns: The backend for the compilation config.\n\nTo complete the initialization after cudagraph related configs are set. This includes: - initialize compile_sizes - pre-compute the mapping bs_to_padded_graph_size\n\nEnable parsing of the cudagraph_mode enum type from string.\n\nEnable parsing the mode field from string mode names. Accepts both integers (0-3) and string names, like NONE, STOCK_TORCH_COMPILE, DYNAMO_TRACE_ONCE, VLLM_COMPILE.\n\nEnable parsing of the pass_config field from a dictionary.\n\nThe compilation approach used for torch.compile-based compilation of the model.\n\nSingle Dynamo trace through the model, avoiding recompilation.\n\nNo torch.compile compilation is applied, model runs in fully eager pytorch mode. The model runs as-is.\n\nThe standard torch.compile compilation pipeline.\n\nCustom vLLM Inductor-based backend with caching, piecewise compilation, shape specialization, and custom passes.\n\nConfiguration to control/debug torch compile dynamic shapes.\n\nA debug mode to detect and fail if Dynamo ever specializes a dynamic shape by guarding on it. When True, dynamic shape guards are not dropped from dynamo. And a failure will be triggered if a recompilation ever happens due to that. This mode requires VLLM_USE_BYTECODE_HOOK to be 0. Enabling this allow observing the dynamic shapes guards in the tlparse artifacts also. When type is backed, aot_compile must be disabled for this mode to work. until this change picked up https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/169239.\n\nControls the type of dynamic shapes handling to use with torch.compile().\n\nProvide a hash for DynamicShapesConfig\n\nTypes of dynamic shapes handling in torch.compile(). see Dynamic shapes and vllm guard dropping in torch_compile.md for more details.\n\nUse backed dynamic shapes. torch.compile() guards on backed dynamic shapes and may add guards. Symbols are specialized to 0, 1, or >=2 even without encountering branching on those ranges.\n\nExperimental flag that treats backed symbols as unbacked when explicit unbacked handling is defined.\n\nUse unbacked dynamic shapes. Guaranteed not to be guarded on and not 0/1 specialized, but may throw data dependent errors when branches require their value without explicit unbacked handling.\n\nConfiguration for custom Inductor passes.\n\nThis is separate from general CompilationConfig so that inductor passes don't all have access to full configuration - that would create a cycle as the PassManager is set as a property of config.\n\nYou must pass PassConfig to VLLMConfig constructor via the CompilationConfig constructor. VLLMConfig's post_init does further initialization. If used outside of the VLLMConfig, some fields may be left in an improper state.\n\nEnable fused Q/K RMSNorm + RoPE pass.\n\nEnable sequence parallelism.\n\nThe threshold of the communicated tensor sizes under which vllm should use flashinfer fused allreduce. Specified as a float in MB. Unspecified will fallback to default values which are compute capability and world size dependent. FI_ALLREDUCE_FUSION_MAX_SIZE_MB = { 90: { 2: 64, # 64MB 4: 2, # 2MB 8: 1, # 1MB }, 100: { 2: 64, # 64MB 4: 32, # 32MB 8: 1, # 1MB }, }, where key is the device capability\n\nFuse the custom SiluMul + quant ops.\n\nEnable flashinfer allreduce fusion.\n\nFuse the custom attention + quant ops.\n\nFuse the custom RMSNorm + quant ops.\n\nSkip validation if the value is None when initialisation is delayed.\n\nProduces a hash unique to the pass configuration. Any new fields that affect compilation should be added to the hash. Any future fields that don't affect compilation should be excluded.\n\nReturns the max communication size in bytes for flashinfer allreduce fusion for the given world size. Returns None if world size is not supported by configs as it's not supported by flashinfer.",

FULL mode: Capture full cudagraph for all batches. Can be good for small models or workloads with small prompts; not supported by many backends. Generally for performance FULL_AND_PIECEWISE is better. FULL_DECODE_ONLY mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches only. Mixed prefill-decode batches are run without cudagraphs. Can be good for decode instances in a P/D setup where prefill is not as important so we can save some memory. FULL_AND_PIECEWISE mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches and piecewise cudagraph for prefill and mixed prefill-decode batches. This is the most performant mode for most models and is the default. Currently, the cudagraph mode is only used for the v1 engine. Note that the cudagraph logic is generally orthogonal to the compilation logic.

When `enable_lora` is False, this option has no effect. \"\"\" use_inductor_graph_partition: bool = Field(default=None) \"\"\"Use inductor graph partition to split the graph at cudagraph_unsafe ops. This partition happens at inductor codegen time after all passes and fusions are finished. It generates a single `call` function which wraps cudagraph-safe ops into partition functions and leave cudagraph-unsafe ops outside the partition functions. For a graph with N cudagraph-unsafe ops (e.g., Attention), there would be N+1 partitions. To mark an op as cudagraph unsafe, we can add `tags=(torch._C.Tag.cudagraph_unsafe)` when register the custom op. This config supports both full cudagraph and piecewise cudagraph without compiling twice. For piecewise cudagraph, it applies vLLM CUDAGraph wrapper to each partition. For N+1 partitions, there would be N+1 CUDAGraph wrapper instances. For full CUDAGraph, we always apply a single CUDAGraph wrapper outside the inductor `call` function in the model runner. The top-level full cudagraph capture ignores all partitioning. \"\"\" pass_config: PassConfig = field(default_factory=PassConfig) \"\"\"Custom inductor passes, see PassConfig for more details\"\"\" max_cudagraph_capture_size: int | None = field(default=None) \"\"\"The maximum cudagraph capture size.

We use string to avoid serialization issues when using compilation in a distributed setting. When the compilation mode is 1 or 2, the backend is used for the compilation directly (it sees the whole graph). When the compilation mode is 3, the backend supports both whole graph and piecewise compilation, available backends include eager, inductor, and custom backends, the latter of which can be defined via get_compile_backend. Furthermore, compilation is only piecewise if splitting ops is set accordingly and use_inductor_graph_partition is off. Note that the default options for splitting ops are sufficient for piecewise compilation. bs_to_padded_graph_size class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ bs_to_padded_graph_size: list[int] = field( default=None, init=False ) optimization: Intuitively, bs_to_padded_graph_size should be dict[int, int]. since we know all keys are in a range [0, max_cudagraph_capture_size], we can optimize it to list[int] for better lookup performance. cache_dir class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cache_dir: str = '' The directory to store the compiled graph, to accelerate Inductor compilation.

Currently, this only works for Qwen2_5_vl on selected platforms. Disabled by default until more models are supported/tested to work. compile_ranges_split_points class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compile_ranges_split_points: list[int] | None = None Split points that represent compile ranges for inductor. The compile ranges are [1, split_points[0]], [split_points[0] + 1, split_points[1]], ..., [split_points[-1] + 1, max_num_batched_tokens]. Compile sizes are also used single element ranges, the range is represented as [compile_sizes[i], compile_sizes[i]]. If a range overlaps with the compile size, graph for compile size will be prioritized, i.e. if we have a range [1, 8] and a compile size 4, graph for compile size 4 will be compiled and used instead of the graph for range [1, 8]. compile_sizes class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compile_sizes: list[int | str] | None = None Sizes to compile for inductor. In addition to integers, it also supports \"cudagraph_capture_sizes\" to specify the sizes for cudagraph capture. cudagraph_capture_sizes class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_capture_sizes: list[int] | None = None Sizes to capture cudagraph. - None (default): capture sizes are inferred from vllm config. - list[int]: capture sizes are specified as given. cudagraph_copy_inputs class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_copy_inputs: bool = False Whether to copy input tensors for cudagraph. If the caller can guarantee that the same input buffers are always used, it can set this to False. Otherwise, it should set this to True, and the compiler will copy the input to an internally managed buffer. Default is False. Note that this flag is only effective when cudagraph_mode is PIECEWISE. cudagraph_mode class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_mode: CUDAGraphMode = Field(default=None) The mode of the cudagraph: NONE, no cudagraph capture. PIECEWISE. FULL. FULL_DECODE_ONLY. FULL_AND_PIECEWISE. (v1 default) PIECEWISE mode build piecewise cudagraph only, keeping the cudagraph incompatible ops (i.e. some attention ops) outside the cudagraph for general flexibility. FULL mode: Capture full cudagraph for all batches. Can be good for small models or workloads with small prompts; not supported by many backends. Generally for performance FULL_AND_PIECEWISE is better. FULL_DECODE_ONLY mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches only. Mixed prefill-decode batches are run without cudagraphs. Can be good for decode instances in a P/D setup where prefill is not as important so we can save some memory. FULL_AND_PIECEWISE mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches and piecewise cudagraph for prefill and mixed prefill-decode batches. This is the most performant mode for most models and is the default. Currently, the cudagraph mode is only used for the v1 engine. Note that the cudagraph logic is generally orthogonal to the compilation logic. While piecewise cudagraphs require piecewise compilation (mode=VLLM_COMPILE and non-empty splitting_ops), full cudagraphs are supported with and without compilation. Warning: This flag is new and subject to change in addition more modes may be added. cudagraph_num_of_warmups class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_num_of_warmups: int = 0 Number of warmup runs for cudagraph. It means the first several runs will be treated as warmup runs. Only after that, the execution will be recorded, and the recorded cudagraph will be used for subsequent runs. cudagraph_specialize_lora class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_specialize_lora: bool = True Whether to create separate cuda graphs for cases with and without active LoRA adapters. When set to False, the LoRA-enabled cuda graph will be used for all cases, incurring the overhead of running LoRA ops even when no adapters are active. Setting this to True will remove this overhead at the cost of increased startup time and slightly higher memory usage. When enable_lora is False, this option has no effect. custom_ops class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ custom_ops: list[str] = field(default_factory=list) Fine-grained control over which custom ops to enable/disable. Use 'all' to enable all, 'none' to disable all. Also specify a list of custom op names to enable (prefixed with a '+'), or disable (prefixed with a '-'). Examples: 'all,-op1' to enable all except op1 'none,+op1,+op2' to enable only op1 and op2 By default, all custom ops are enabled when running without Inductor and disabled when running with Inductor: mode>=VLLM_COMPILE and backend=\"inductor\". Inductor generates (fused) Triton kernels for disabled custom ops. debug_dump_path class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ debug_dump_path: Path | None = None The path to dump the debug information. disabled_custom_ops class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ disabled_custom_ops: Counter[str] = field( default_factory=Counter, init=False ) custom ops that are disabled dynamic_shapes_config class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ dynamic_shapes_config: DynamicShapesConfig = field( default_factory=DynamicShapesConfig ) Configuration for dynamic shapes options enabled_custom_ops class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ enabled_custom_ops: Counter[str] = field( default_factory=Counter, init=False ) custom ops that are enabled inductor_compile_config class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ inductor_compile_config: dict = field(default_factory=dict) Additional configurations for inductor. - None: use default configurations. inductor_passes class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ inductor_passes: dict[str, str] = field( default_factory=dict ) Additional passes for inductor. It is a dictionary from pass name to pass function qualified name. We use function name because the config uses JSON format. If we pass the config from Python, functions can also be passed directly via Python object constructor, e.g. CompilationConfig(inductor_passes={\"a\": func}). level class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ level: int = Field(default=None) Level is deprecated and will be removed in the next release, either 0.12.0 or 0.11.2 whichever is soonest. Please use mode. Currently all levels are mapped to mode. local_cache_dir class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ local_cache_dir: str = field(default=None, init=False) local cache dir for each rank max_cudagraph_capture_size class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ max_cudagraph_capture_size: int | None = field(default=None) The maximum cudagraph capture size. If cudagraph_capture_sizes is specified, this will be set to the largest size in that list (or checked for consistency if specified). If cudagraph_capture_sizes is not specified, the list of sizes is generated automatically following the pattern: [1, 2, 4] + list(range(8, 256, 8)) + list( range(256, max_cudagraph_capture_size + 1, 16)) If not specified, max_cudagraph_capture_size is set to min(max_num_seqs*2, 512) by default. This voids OOM in tight memory scenarios with small max_num_seqs, and prevents capture of many large graphs (>512) that would greatly increase startup time with limited performance benefit. mode class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ mode: CompilationMode = Field(default=None) The compilation approach used for torch.compile-based compilation of the model. None: If None, we will select the default compilation mode. For V1 engine this is 3. 0: NONE: No torch.compile compilation is applied, model runs in fully eager pytorch mode. The model runs as-is. 1: STOCK_TORCH_COMPILE: The standard torch.compile compilation pipeline. 2: DYNAMO_TRACE_ONCE: Single Dynamo trace through the model, avoiding recompilation by removing guards. Requires no dynamic-shape-dependent control-flow. 3: VLLM_COMPILE: Custom vLLM Inductor-based backend with caching, piecewise compilation, shape specialization, and custom passes. pass_config class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ pass_config: PassConfig = field(default_factory=PassConfig) Custom inductor passes, see PassConfig for more details splitting_ops class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ splitting_ops: list[str] | None = None A list of ops to exclude from cudagraphs, used in piecewise compilation. The behavior depends on use_inductor_graph_partition: When use_inductor_graph_partition=False (default): These ops are used for Dynamo FX-level graph splitting. The graph is split at these ops before Inductor compilation, creating separate subgraphs for cudagraph capture. When use_inductor_graph_partition=True: These ops are used to register Inductor partition rules. The graph partitioning happens at Inductor codegen time after all passes and fusions are finished, allowing compilation and custom passes to operate on the full graph while still excluding these ops from cudagraphs. If None, defaults to attention ops for piecewise cudagraphs. If empty list [], no ops are excluded (suitable for full cudagraphs). static_forward_context class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ static_forward_context: dict[str, Any] = field( default_factory=dict, init=False ) Per-model forward context Map from layer name to layer objects that need to be accessed outside model code, e.g., Attention, FusedMOE when dp_size>1. traced_files class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ traced_files: set[str] = field( default_factory=set, init=False ) files that are traced for compilation use_inductor_graph_partition class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ use_inductor_graph_partition: bool = Field(default=None) Use inductor graph partition to split the graph at cudagraph_unsafe ops. This partition happens at inductor codegen time after all passes and fusions are finished. It generates a single call function which wraps cudagraph-safe ops into partition functions and leave cudagraph-unsafe ops outside the partition functions. For a graph with N cudagraph-unsafe ops (e.g., Attention), there would be N+1 partitions. To mark an op as cudagraph unsafe, we can add tags=(torch._C.Tag.cudagraph_unsafe) when register the custom op. This config supports both full cudagraph and piecewise cudagraph without compiling twice. For piecewise cudagraph, it applies vLLM CUDAGraph wrapper to each partition. For N+1 partitions, there would be N+1 CUDAGraph wrapper instances. For full CUDAGraph, we always apply a single CUDAGraph wrapper outside the inductor call function in the model runner. The top-level full cudagraph capture ignores all partitioning. __post_init__ ¶ __post_init__() -> None Source code in vllm/config/compilation.py 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827 828 829 830def __post_init__(self) -> None: if self.level is not None: logger.warning( \"Level is deprecated and will be removed in the next release,\" \"either 0.12.0 or 0.11.2 whichever is soonest.\" \"Use mode instead.\" \"If both level and mode are given,\" \"only mode will be used.\" ) if self.mode is None: self.mode = self.level count_none = self.custom_ops.count(\"none\") count_all = self.custom_ops.count(\"all\") assert count_none + count_all <= 1, \"Can only specify 'none' or 'all'\" # TODO(zou3519/luka): There are 2 issues with auto-functionalization V2: # 1.

FULL mode: Capture full cudagraph for all batches. Can be good for small models or workloads with small prompts; not supported by many backends. Generally for performance FULL_AND_PIECEWISE is better. FULL_DECODE_ONLY mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches only. Mixed prefill-decode batches are run without cudagraphs. Can be good for decode instances in a P/D setup where prefill is not as important so we can save some memory. FULL_AND_PIECEWISE mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches and piecewise cudagraph for prefill and mixed prefill-decode batches. This is the most performant mode for most models and is the default. Currently, the cudagraph mode is only used for the v1 engine.

To mark an op as cudagraph unsafe, we can add `tags=(torch._C.Tag.cudagraph_unsafe)` when register the custom op. This config supports both full cudagraph and piecewise cudagraph without compiling twice. For piecewise cudagraph, it applies vLLM CUDAGraph wrapper to each partition.

We use string to avoid serialization issues when using compilation in a distributed setting. When the compilation mode is 1 or 2, the backend is used for the compilation directly (it sees the whole graph). When the compilation mode is 3, the backend supports both whole graph and piecewise compilation, available backends include eager, inductor, and custom backends, the latter of which can be defined via get_compile_backend. Furthermore, compilation is only piecewise if splitting ops is set accordingly and use_inductor_graph_partition is off. Note that the default options for splitting ops are sufficient for piecewise compilation. bs_to_padded_graph_size class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ bs_to_padded_graph_size: list[int] = field( default=None, init=False ) optimization: Intuitively, bs_to_padded_graph_size should be dict[int, int]. since we know all keys are in a range [0, max_cudagraph_capture_size], we can optimize it to list[int] for better lookup performance. cache_dir class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cache_dir: str = '' The directory to store the compiled graph, to accelerate Inductor compilation. By default, it will use model-related information to generate a cache directory. compilation_time class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compilation_time: float = field(default=0.0, init=False) time taken for compilation compile_cache_save_format class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compile_cache_save_format: Literal[\"binary\", \"unpacked\"] = ( field( default_factory=lambda: VLLM_COMPILE_CACHE_SAVE_FORMAT ) ) Format for saving torch compile cache: \"binary\": saves as binary file (multiprocess safe) \"unpacked\": saves as directory structure for inspection/debugging (NOT multiprocess safe) Defaults to VLLM_COMPILE_CACHE_SAVE_FORMAT if not specified. compile_mm_encoder class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compile_mm_encoder: bool = False Whether or not to compile the multimodal encoder. Currently, this only works for Qwen2_5_vl on selected platforms. Disabled by default until more models are supported/tested to work. compile_ranges_split_points class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compile_ranges_split_points: list[int] | None = None Split points that represent compile ranges for inductor. The compile ranges are [1, split_points[0]], [split_points[0] + 1, split_points[1]], ..., [split_points[-1] + 1, max_num_batched_tokens]. Compile sizes are also used single element ranges, the range is represented as [compile_sizes[i], compile_sizes[i]]. If a range overlaps with the compile size, graph for compile size will be prioritized, i.e. if we have a range [1, 8] and a compile size 4, graph for compile size 4 will be compiled and used instead of the graph for range [1, 8]. compile_sizes class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compile_sizes: list[int | str] | None = None Sizes to compile for inductor. In addition to integers, it also supports \"cudagraph_capture_sizes\" to specify the sizes for cudagraph capture. cudagraph_capture_sizes class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_capture_sizes: list[int] | None = None Sizes to capture cudagraph. - None (default): capture sizes are inferred from vllm config. - list[int]: capture sizes are specified as given. cudagraph_copy_inputs class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_copy_inputs: bool = False Whether to copy input tensors for cudagraph. If the caller can guarantee that the same input buffers are always used, it can set this to False. Otherwise, it should set this to True, and the compiler will copy the input to an internally managed buffer. Default is False. Note that this flag is only effective when cudagraph_mode is PIECEWISE. cudagraph_mode class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_mode: CUDAGraphMode = Field(default=None) The mode of the cudagraph: NONE, no cudagraph capture. PIECEWISE. FULL. FULL_DECODE_ONLY. FULL_AND_PIECEWISE. (v1 default) PIECEWISE mode build piecewise cudagraph only, keeping the cudagraph incompatible ops (i.e. some attention ops) outside the cudagraph for general flexibility. FULL mode: Capture full cudagraph for all batches. Can be good for small models or workloads with small prompts; not supported by many backends. Generally for performance FULL_AND_PIECEWISE is better. FULL_DECODE_ONLY mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches only. Mixed prefill-decode batches are run without cudagraphs. Can be good for decode instances in a P/D setup where prefill is not as important so we can save some memory. FULL_AND_PIECEWISE mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches and piecewise cudagraph for prefill and mixed prefill-decode batches. This is the most performant mode for most models and is the default. Currently, the cudagraph mode is only used for the v1 engine. Note that the cudagraph logic is generally orthogonal to the compilation logic. While piecewise cudagraphs require piecewise compilation (mode=VLLM_COMPILE and non-empty splitting_ops), full cudagraphs are supported with and without compilation. Warning: This flag is new and subject to change in addition more modes may be added. cudagraph_num_of_warmups class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_num_of_warmups: int = 0 Number of warmup runs for cudagraph. It means the first several runs will be treated as warmup runs. Only after that, the execution will be recorded, and the recorded cudagraph will be used for subsequent runs. cudagraph_specialize_lora class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_specialize_lora: bool = True Whether to create separate cuda graphs for cases with and without active LoRA adapters. When set to False, the LoRA-enabled cuda graph will be used for all cases, incurring the overhead of running LoRA ops even when no adapters are active. Setting this to True will remove this overhead at the cost of increased startup time and slightly higher memory usage. When enable_lora is False, this option has no effect. custom_ops class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ custom_ops: list[str] = field(default_factory=list) Fine-grained control over which custom ops to enable/disable. Use 'all' to enable all, 'none' to disable all. Also specify a list of custom op names to enable (prefixed with a '+'), or disable (prefixed with a '-'). Examples: 'all,-op1' to enable all except op1 'none,+op1,+op2' to enable only op1 and op2 By default, all custom ops are enabled when running without Inductor and disabled when running with Inductor: mode>=VLLM_COMPILE and backend=\"inductor\". Inductor generates (fused) Triton kernels for disabled custom ops. debug_dump_path class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ debug_dump_path: Path | None = None The path to dump the debug information. disabled_custom_ops class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ disabled_custom_ops: Counter[str] = field( default_factory=Counter, init=False ) custom ops that are disabled dynamic_shapes_config class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ dynamic_shapes_config: DynamicShapesConfig = field( default_factory=DynamicShapesConfig ) Configuration for dynamic shapes options enabled_custom_ops class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ enabled_custom_ops: Counter[str] = field( default_factory=Counter, init=False ) custom ops that are enabled inductor_compile_config class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ inductor_compile_config: dict = field(default_factory=dict) Additional configurations for inductor. - None: use default configurations. inductor_passes class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ inductor_passes: dict[str, str] = field( default_factory=dict ) Additional passes for inductor. It is a dictionary from pass name to pass function qualified name. We use function name because the config uses JSON format. If we pass the config from Python, functions can also be passed directly via Python object constructor, e.g. CompilationConfig(inductor_passes={\"a\": func}). level class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ level: int = Field(default=None) Level is deprecated and will be removed in the next release, either 0.12.0 or 0.11.2 whichever is soonest. Please use mode. Currently all levels are mapped to mode. local_cache_dir class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ local_cache_dir: str = field(default=None, init=False) local cache dir for each rank max_cudagraph_capture_size class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ max_cudagraph_capture_size: int | None = field(default=None) The maximum cudagraph capture size. If cudagraph_capture_sizes is specified, this will be set to the largest size in that list (or checked for consistency if specified). If cudagraph_capture_sizes is not specified, the list of sizes is generated automatically following the pattern: [1, 2, 4] + list(range(8, 256, 8)) + list( range(256, max_cudagraph_capture_size + 1, 16)) If not specified, max_cudagraph_capture_size is set to min(max_num_seqs*2, 512) by default. This voids OOM in tight memory scenarios with small max_num_seqs, and prevents capture of many large graphs (>512) that would greatly increase startup time with limited performance benefit. mode class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ mode: CompilationMode = Field(default=None) The compilation approach used for torch.compile-based compilation of the model. None: If None, we will select the default compilation mode. For V1 engine this is 3. 0: NONE: No torch.compile compilation is applied, model runs in fully eager pytorch mode. The model runs as-is. 1: STOCK_TORCH_COMPILE: The standard torch.compile compilation pipeline. 2: DYNAMO_TRACE_ONCE: Single Dynamo trace through the model, avoiding recompilation by removing guards. Requires no dynamic-shape-dependent control-flow. 3: VLLM_COMPILE: Custom vLLM Inductor-based backend with caching, piecewise compilation, shape specialization, and custom passes. pass_config class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ pass_config: PassConfig = field(default_factory=PassConfig) Custom inductor passes, see PassConfig for more details splitting_ops class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ splitting_ops: list[str] | None = None A list of ops to exclude from cudagraphs, used in piecewise compilation. The behavior depends on use_inductor_graph_partition: When use_inductor_graph_partition=False (default): These ops are used for Dynamo FX-level graph splitting. The graph is split at these ops before Inductor compilation, creating separate subgraphs for cudagraph capture. When use_inductor_graph_partition=True: These ops are used to register Inductor partition rules. The graph partitioning happens at Inductor codegen time after all passes and fusions are finished, allowing compilation and custom passes to operate on the full graph while still excluding these ops from cudagraphs. If None, defaults to attention ops for piecewise cudagraphs. If empty list [], no ops are excluded (suitable for full cudagraphs). static_forward_context class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ static_forward_context: dict[str, Any] = field( default_factory=dict, init=False ) Per-model forward context Map from layer name to layer objects that need to be accessed outside model code, e.g., Attention, FusedMOE when dp_size>1. traced_files class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ traced_files: set[str] = field( default_factory=set, init=False ) files that are traced for compilation use_inductor_graph_partition class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ use_inductor_graph_partition: bool = Field(default=None) Use inductor graph partition to split the graph at cudagraph_unsafe ops. This partition happens at inductor codegen time after all passes and fusions are finished. It generates a single call function which wraps cudagraph-safe ops into partition functions and leave cudagraph-unsafe ops outside the partition functions. For a graph with N cudagraph-unsafe ops (e.g., Attention), there would be N+1 partitions. To mark an op as cudagraph unsafe, we can add tags=(torch._C.Tag.cudagraph_unsafe) when register the custom op. This config supports both full cudagraph and piecewise cudagraph without compiling twice. For piecewise cudagraph, it applies vLLM CUDAGraph wrapper to each partition. For N+1 partitions, there would be N+1 CUDAGraph wrapper instances. For full CUDAGraph, we always apply a single CUDAGraph wrapper outside the inductor call function in the model runner. The top-level full cudagraph capture ignores all partitioning. __post_init__ ¶ __post_init__() -> None Source code in vllm/config/compilation.py 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827 828 829 830def __post_init__(self) -> None: if self.level is not None: logger.warning( \"Level is deprecated and will be removed in the next release,\" \"either 0.12.0 or 0.11.2 whichever is soonest.\" \"Use mode instead.\" \"If both level and mode are given,\" \"only mode will be used.\" ) if self.mode is None: self.mode = self.level count_none = self.custom_ops.count(\"none\") count_all = self.custom_ops.count(\"all\") assert count_none + count_all <= 1, \"Can only specify 'none' or 'all'\" # TODO(zou3519/luka): There are 2 issues with auto-functionalization V2: # 1.

FULL mode: Capture full cudagraph for all batches. Can be good for small models or workloads with small prompts; not supported by many backends. Generally for performance FULL_AND_PIECEWISE is better. FULL_DECODE_ONLY mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches only. Mixed prefill-decode batches are run without cudagraphs. Can be good for decode instances in a P/D setup where prefill is not as important so we can save some memory. FULL_AND_PIECEWISE mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches and piecewise cudagraph for prefill and mixed prefill-decode batches. This is the most performant mode for most models and is the default. Currently, the cudagraph mode is only used for the v1 engine.

To mark an op as cudagraph unsafe, we can add `tags=(torch._C.Tag.cudagraph_unsafe)` when register the custom op. This config supports both full cudagraph and piecewise cudagraph without compiling twice. For piecewise cudagraph, it applies vLLM CUDAGraph wrapper to each partition.

We use string to avoid serialization issues when using compilation in a distributed setting. When the compilation mode is 1 or 2, the backend is used for the compilation directly (it sees the whole graph). When the compilation mode is 3, the backend supports both whole graph and piecewise compilation, available backends include eager, inductor, and custom backends, the latter of which can be defined via get_compile_backend. Furthermore, compilation is only piecewise if splitting ops is set accordingly and use_inductor_graph_partition is off. Note that the default options for splitting ops are sufficient for piecewise compilation. bs_to_padded_graph_size class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ bs_to_padded_graph_size: list[int] = field( default=None, init=False ) optimization: Intuitively, bs_to_padded_graph_size should be dict[int, int]. since we know all keys are in a range [0, max_cudagraph_capture_size], we can optimize it to list[int] for better lookup performance. cache_dir class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cache_dir: str = '' The directory to store the compiled graph, to accelerate Inductor compilation. By default, it will use model-related information to generate a cache directory. compilation_time class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compilation_time: float = field(default=0.0, init=False) time taken for compilation compile_cache_save_format class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compile_cache_save_format: Literal[\"binary\", \"unpacked\"] = ( field( default_factory=lambda: VLLM_COMPILE_CACHE_SAVE_FORMAT ) ) Format for saving torch compile cache: \"binary\": saves as binary file (multiprocess safe) \"unpacked\": saves as directory structure for inspection/debugging (NOT multiprocess safe) Defaults to VLLM_COMPILE_CACHE_SAVE_FORMAT if not specified. compile_mm_encoder class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compile_mm_encoder: bool = False Whether or not to compile the multimodal encoder. Currently, this only works for Qwen2_5_vl on selected platforms. Disabled by default until more models are supported/tested to work. compile_ranges_split_points class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compile_ranges_split_points: list[int] | None = None Split points that represent compile ranges for inductor. The compile ranges are [1, split_points[0]], [split_points[0] + 1, split_points[1]], ..., [split_points[-1] + 1, max_num_batched_tokens]. Compile sizes are also used single element ranges, the range is represented as [compile_sizes[i], compile_sizes[i]]. If a range overlaps with the compile size, graph for compile size will be prioritized, i.e. if we have a range [1, 8] and a compile size 4, graph for compile size 4 will be compiled and used instead of the graph for range [1, 8]. compile_sizes class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compile_sizes: list[int | str] | None = None Sizes to compile for inductor. In addition to integers, it also supports \"cudagraph_capture_sizes\" to specify the sizes for cudagraph capture. cudagraph_capture_sizes class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_capture_sizes: list[int] | None = None Sizes to capture cudagraph. - None (default): capture sizes are inferred from vllm config. - list[int]: capture sizes are specified as given. cudagraph_copy_inputs class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_copy_inputs: bool = False Whether to copy input tensors for cudagraph. If the caller can guarantee that the same input buffers are always used, it can set this to False. Otherwise, it should set this to True, and the compiler will copy the input to an internally managed buffer. Default is False. Note that this flag is only effective when cudagraph_mode is PIECEWISE. cudagraph_mode class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_mode: CUDAGraphMode = Field(default=None) The mode of the cudagraph: NONE, no cudagraph capture. PIECEWISE. FULL. FULL_DECODE_ONLY. FULL_AND_PIECEWISE. (v1 default) PIECEWISE mode build piecewise cudagraph only, keeping the cudagraph incompatible ops (i.e. some attention ops) outside the cudagraph for general flexibility. FULL mode: Capture full cudagraph for all batches. Can be good for small models or workloads with small prompts; not supported by many backends. Generally for performance FULL_AND_PIECEWISE is better. FULL_DECODE_ONLY mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches only. Mixed prefill-decode batches are run without cudagraphs. Can be good for decode instances in a P/D setup where prefill is not as important so we can save some memory. FULL_AND_PIECEWISE mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches and piecewise cudagraph for prefill and mixed prefill-decode batches. This is the most performant mode for most models and is the default. Currently, the cudagraph mode is only used for the v1 engine. Note that the cudagraph logic is generally orthogonal to the compilation logic. While piecewise cudagraphs require piecewise compilation (mode=VLLM_COMPILE and non-empty splitting_ops), full cudagraphs are supported with and without compilation. Warning: This flag is new and subject to change in addition more modes may be added. cudagraph_num_of_warmups class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_num_of_warmups: int = 0 Number of warmup runs for cudagraph. It means the first several runs will be treated as warmup runs. Only after that, the execution will be recorded, and the recorded cudagraph will be used for subsequent runs. cudagraph_specialize_lora class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_specialize_lora: bool = True Whether to create separate cuda graphs for cases with and without active LoRA adapters. When set to False, the LoRA-enabled cuda graph will be used for all cases, incurring the overhead of running LoRA ops even when no adapters are active. Setting this to True will remove this overhead at the cost of increased startup time and slightly higher memory usage. When enable_lora is False, this option has no effect. custom_ops class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ custom_ops: list[str] = field(default_factory=list) Fine-grained control over which custom ops to enable/disable. Use 'all' to enable all, 'none' to disable all. Also specify a list of custom op names to enable (prefixed with a '+'), or disable (prefixed with a '-'). Examples: 'all,-op1' to enable all except op1 'none,+op1,+op2' to enable only op1 and op2 By default, all custom ops are enabled when running without Inductor and disabled when running with Inductor: mode>=VLLM_COMPILE and backend=\"inductor\". Inductor generates (fused) Triton kernels for disabled custom ops. debug_dump_path class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ debug_dump_path: Path | None = None The path to dump the debug information. disabled_custom_ops class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ disabled_custom_ops: Counter[str] = field( default_factory=Counter, init=False ) custom ops that are disabled dynamic_shapes_config class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ dynamic_shapes_config: DynamicShapesConfig = field( default_factory=DynamicShapesConfig ) Configuration for dynamic shapes options enabled_custom_ops class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ enabled_custom_ops: Counter[str] = field( default_factory=Counter, init=False ) custom ops that are enabled inductor_compile_config class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ inductor_compile_config: dict = field(default_factory=dict) Additional configurations for inductor. - None: use default configurations. inductor_passes class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ inductor_passes: dict[str, str] = field( default_factory=dict ) Additional passes for inductor. It is a dictionary from pass name to pass function qualified name. We use function name because the config uses JSON format. If we pass the config from Python, functions can also be passed directly via Python object constructor, e.g. CompilationConfig(inductor_passes={\"a\": func}). level class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ level: int = Field(default=None) Level is deprecated and will be removed in the next release, either 0.12.0 or 0.11.2 whichever is soonest. Please use mode. Currently all levels are mapped to mode. local_cache_dir class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ local_cache_dir: str = field(default=None, init=False) local cache dir for each rank max_cudagraph_capture_size class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ max_cudagraph_capture_size: int | None = field(default=None) The maximum cudagraph capture size. If cudagraph_capture_sizes is specified, this will be set to the largest size in that list (or checked for consistency if specified). If cudagraph_capture_sizes is not specified, the list of sizes is generated automatically following the pattern: [1, 2, 4] + list(range(8, 256, 8)) + list( range(256, max_cudagraph_capture_size + 1, 16)) If not specified, max_cudagraph_capture_size is set to min(max_num_seqs*2, 512) by default. This voids OOM in tight memory scenarios with small max_num_seqs, and prevents capture of many large graphs (>512) that would greatly increase startup time with limited performance benefit. mode class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ mode: CompilationMode = Field(default=None) The compilation approach used for torch.compile-based compilation of the model. None: If None, we will select the default compilation mode. For V1 engine this is 3. 0: NONE: No torch.compile compilation is applied, model runs in fully eager pytorch mode. The model runs as-is. 1: STOCK_TORCH_COMPILE: The standard torch.compile compilation pipeline. 2: DYNAMO_TRACE_ONCE: Single Dynamo trace through the model, avoiding recompilation by removing guards. Requires no dynamic-shape-dependent control-flow. 3: VLLM_COMPILE: Custom vLLM Inductor-based backend with caching, piecewise compilation, shape specialization, and custom passes. pass_config class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ pass_config: PassConfig = field(default_factory=PassConfig) Custom inductor passes, see PassConfig for more details splitting_ops class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ splitting_ops: list[str] | None = None A list of ops to exclude from cudagraphs, used in piecewise compilation. The behavior depends on use_inductor_graph_partition: When use_inductor_graph_partition=False (default): These ops are used for Dynamo FX-level graph splitting. The graph is split at these ops before Inductor compilation, creating separate subgraphs for cudagraph capture. When use_inductor_graph_partition=True: These ops are used to register Inductor partition rules. The graph partitioning happens at Inductor codegen time after all passes and fusions are finished, allowing compilation and custom passes to operate on the full graph while still excluding these ops from cudagraphs. If None, defaults to attention ops for piecewise cudagraphs. If empty list [], no ops are excluded (suitable for full cudagraphs). static_forward_context class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ static_forward_context: dict[str, Any] = field( default_factory=dict, init=False ) Per-model forward context Map from layer name to layer objects that need to be accessed outside model code, e.g., Attention, FusedMOE when dp_size>1. traced_files class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ traced_files: set[str] = field( default_factory=set, init=False ) files that are traced for compilation use_inductor_graph_partition class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ use_inductor_graph_partition: bool = Field(default=None) Use inductor graph partition to split the graph at cudagraph_unsafe ops. This partition happens at inductor codegen time after all passes and fusions are finished. It generates a single call function which wraps cudagraph-safe ops into partition functions and leave cudagraph-unsafe ops outside the partition functions. For a graph with N cudagraph-unsafe ops (e.g., Attention), there would be N+1 partitions. To mark an op as cudagraph unsafe, we can add tags=(torch._C.Tag.cudagraph_unsafe) when register the custom op. This config supports both full cudagraph and piecewise cudagraph without compiling twice. For piecewise cudagraph, it applies vLLM CUDAGraph wrapper to each partition. For N+1 partitions, there would be N+1 CUDAGraph wrapper instances. For full CUDAGraph, we always apply a single CUDAGraph wrapper outside the inductor call function in the model runner. The top-level full cudagraph capture ignores all partitioning. __post_init__ ¶ __post_init__() -> None Source code in vllm/config/compilation.py 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827 828 829 830def __post_init__(self) -> None: if self.level is not None: logger.warning( \"Level is deprecated and will be removed in the next release,\" \"either 0.12.0 or 0.11.2 whichever is soonest.\" \"Use mode instead.\" \"If both level and mode are given,\" \"only mode will be used.\" ) if self.mode is None: self.mode = self.level count_none = self.custom_ops.count(\"none\") count_all = self.custom_ops.count(\"all\") assert count_none + count_all <= 1, \"Can only specify 'none' or 'all'\" # TODO(zou3519/luka): There are 2 issues with auto-functionalization V2: # 1.

FULL mode: Capture full cudagraph for all batches. Can be good for small models or workloads with small prompts; not supported by many backends. Generally for performance FULL_AND_PIECEWISE is better. FULL_DECODE_ONLY mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches only. Mixed prefill-decode batches are run without cudagraphs. Can be good for decode instances in a P/D setup where prefill is not as important so we can save some memory. FULL_AND_PIECEWISE mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches and piecewise cudagraph for prefill and mixed prefill-decode batches. This is the most performant mode for most models and is the default. Currently, the cudagraph mode is only used for the v1 engine.

To mark an op as cudagraph unsafe, we can add `tags=(torch._C.Tag.cudagraph_unsafe)` when register the custom op. This config supports both full cudagraph and piecewise cudagraph without compiling twice. For piecewise cudagraph, it applies vLLM CUDAGraph wrapper to each partition.

We use string to avoid serialization issues when using compilation in a distributed setting. When the compilation mode is 1 or 2, the backend is used for the compilation directly (it sees the whole graph). When the compilation mode is 3, the backend supports both whole graph and piecewise compilation, available backends include eager, inductor, and custom backends, the latter of which can be defined via get_compile_backend. Furthermore, compilation is only piecewise if splitting ops is set accordingly and use_inductor_graph_partition is off. Note that the default options for splitting ops are sufficient for piecewise compilation. bs_to_padded_graph_size class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ bs_to_padded_graph_size: list[int] = field( default=None, init=False ) optimization: Intuitively, bs_to_padded_graph_size should be dict[int, int]. since we know all keys are in a range [0, max_cudagraph_capture_size], we can optimize it to list[int] for better lookup performance. cache_dir class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cache_dir: str = '' The directory to store the compiled graph, to accelerate Inductor compilation. By default, it will use model-related information to generate a cache directory. compilation_time class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compilation_time: float = field(default=0.0, init=False) time taken for compilation compile_cache_save_format class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compile_cache_save_format: Literal[\"binary\", \"unpacked\"] = ( field( default_factory=lambda: VLLM_COMPILE_CACHE_SAVE_FORMAT ) ) Format for saving torch compile cache: \"binary\": saves as binary file (multiprocess safe) \"unpacked\": saves as directory structure for inspection/debugging (NOT multiprocess safe) Defaults to VLLM_COMPILE_CACHE_SAVE_FORMAT if not specified. compile_mm_encoder class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compile_mm_encoder: bool = False Whether or not to compile the multimodal encoder. Currently, this only works for Qwen2_5_vl on selected platforms. Disabled by default until more models are supported/tested to work. compile_ranges_split_points class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compile_ranges_split_points: list[int] | None = None Split points that represent compile ranges for inductor. The compile ranges are [1, split_points[0]], [split_points[0] + 1, split_points[1]], ..., [split_points[-1] + 1, max_num_batched_tokens]. Compile sizes are also used single element ranges, the range is represented as [compile_sizes[i], compile_sizes[i]]. If a range overlaps with the compile size, graph for compile size will be prioritized, i.e. if we have a range [1, 8] and a compile size 4, graph for compile size 4 will be compiled and used instead of the graph for range [1, 8]. compile_sizes class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compile_sizes: list[int | str] | None = None Sizes to compile for inductor. In addition to integers, it also supports \"cudagraph_capture_sizes\" to specify the sizes for cudagraph capture. cudagraph_capture_sizes class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_capture_sizes: list[int] | None = None Sizes to capture cudagraph. - None (default): capture sizes are inferred from vllm config. - list[int]: capture sizes are specified as given. cudagraph_copy_inputs class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_copy_inputs: bool = False Whether to copy input tensors for cudagraph. If the caller can guarantee that the same input buffers are always used, it can set this to False. Otherwise, it should set this to True, and the compiler will copy the input to an internally managed buffer. Default is False. Note that this flag is only effective when cudagraph_mode is PIECEWISE. cudagraph_mode class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_mode: CUDAGraphMode = Field(default=None) The mode of the cudagraph: NONE, no cudagraph capture. PIECEWISE. FULL. FULL_DECODE_ONLY. FULL_AND_PIECEWISE. (v1 default) PIECEWISE mode build piecewise cudagraph only, keeping the cudagraph incompatible ops (i.e. some attention ops) outside the cudagraph for general flexibility. FULL mode: Capture full cudagraph for all batches. Can be good for small models or workloads with small prompts; not supported by many backends. Generally for performance FULL_AND_PIECEWISE is better. FULL_DECODE_ONLY mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches only. Mixed prefill-decode batches are run without cudagraphs. Can be good for decode instances in a P/D setup where prefill is not as important so we can save some memory. FULL_AND_PIECEWISE mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches and piecewise cudagraph for prefill and mixed prefill-decode batches. This is the most performant mode for most models and is the default. Currently, the cudagraph mode is only used for the v1 engine. Note that the cudagraph logic is generally orthogonal to the compilation logic. While piecewise cudagraphs require piecewise compilation (mode=VLLM_COMPILE and non-empty splitting_ops), full cudagraphs are supported with and without compilation. Warning: This flag is new and subject to change in addition more modes may be added. cudagraph_num_of_warmups class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_num_of_warmups: int = 0 Number of warmup runs for cudagraph. It means the first several runs will be treated as warmup runs. Only after that, the execution will be recorded, and the recorded cudagraph will be used for subsequent runs. cudagraph_specialize_lora class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_specialize_lora: bool = True Whether to create separate cuda graphs for cases with and without active LoRA adapters. When set to False, the LoRA-enabled cuda graph will be used for all cases, incurring the overhead of running LoRA ops even when no adapters are active. Setting this to True will remove this overhead at the cost of increased startup time and slightly higher memory usage. When enable_lora is False, this option has no effect. custom_ops class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ custom_ops: list[str] = field(default_factory=list) Fine-grained control over which custom ops to enable/disable. Use 'all' to enable all, 'none' to disable all. Also specify a list of custom op names to enable (prefixed with a '+'), or disable (prefixed with a '-'). Examples: 'all,-op1' to enable all except op1 'none,+op1,+op2' to enable only op1 and op2 By default, all custom ops are enabled when running without Inductor and disabled when running with Inductor: mode>=VLLM_COMPILE and backend=\"inductor\". Inductor generates (fused) Triton kernels for disabled custom ops. debug_dump_path class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ debug_dump_path: Path | None = None The path to dump the debug information. disabled_custom_ops class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ disabled_custom_ops: Counter[str] = field( default_factory=Counter, init=False ) custom ops that are disabled dynamic_shapes_config class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ dynamic_shapes_config: DynamicShapesConfig = field( default_factory=DynamicShapesConfig ) Configuration for dynamic shapes options enabled_custom_ops class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ enabled_custom_ops: Counter[str] = field( default_factory=Counter, init=False ) custom ops that are enabled inductor_compile_config class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ inductor_compile_config: dict = field(default_factory=dict) Additional configurations for inductor. - None: use default configurations. inductor_passes class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ inductor_passes: dict[str, str] = field( default_factory=dict ) Additional passes for inductor. It is a dictionary from pass name to pass function qualified name. We use function name because the config uses JSON format. If we pass the config from Python, functions can also be passed directly via Python object constructor, e.g. CompilationConfig(inductor_passes={\"a\": func}). level class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ level: int = Field(default=None) Level is deprecated and will be removed in the next release, either 0.12.0 or 0.11.2 whichever is soonest. Please use mode. Currently all levels are mapped to mode. local_cache_dir class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ local_cache_dir: str = field(default=None, init=False) local cache dir for each rank max_cudagraph_capture_size class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ max_cudagraph_capture_size: int | None = field(default=None) The maximum cudagraph capture size. If cudagraph_capture_sizes is specified, this will be set to the largest size in that list (or checked for consistency if specified). If cudagraph_capture_sizes is not specified, the list of sizes is generated automatically following the pattern: [1, 2, 4] + list(range(8, 256, 8)) + list( range(256, max_cudagraph_capture_size + 1, 16)) If not specified, max_cudagraph_capture_size is set to min(max_num_seqs*2, 512) by default. This voids OOM in tight memory scenarios with small max_num_seqs, and prevents capture of many large graphs (>512) that would greatly increase startup time with limited performance benefit. mode class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ mode: CompilationMode = Field(default=None) The compilation approach used for torch.compile-based compilation of the model. None: If None, we will select the default compilation mode. For V1 engine this is 3. 0: NONE: No torch.compile compilation is applied, model runs in fully eager pytorch mode. The model runs as-is. 1: STOCK_TORCH_COMPILE: The standard torch.compile compilation pipeline. 2: DYNAMO_TRACE_ONCE: Single Dynamo trace through the model, avoiding recompilation by removing guards. Requires no dynamic-shape-dependent control-flow. 3: VLLM_COMPILE: Custom vLLM Inductor-based backend with caching, piecewise compilation, shape specialization, and custom passes. pass_config class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ pass_config: PassConfig = field(default_factory=PassConfig) Custom inductor passes, see PassConfig for more details splitting_ops class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ splitting_ops: list[str] | None = None A list of ops to exclude from cudagraphs, used in piecewise compilation. The behavior depends on use_inductor_graph_partition: When use_inductor_graph_partition=False (default): These ops are used for Dynamo FX-level graph splitting. The graph is split at these ops before Inductor compilation, creating separate subgraphs for cudagraph capture. When use_inductor_graph_partition=True: These ops are used to register Inductor partition rules. The graph partitioning happens at Inductor codegen time after all passes and fusions are finished, allowing compilation and custom passes to operate on the full graph while still excluding these ops from cudagraphs. If None, defaults to attention ops for piecewise cudagraphs. If empty list [], no ops are excluded (suitable for full cudagraphs). static_forward_context class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ static_forward_context: dict[str, Any] = field( default_factory=dict, init=False ) Per-model forward context Map from layer name to layer objects that need to be accessed outside model code, e.g., Attention, FusedMOE when dp_size>1. traced_files class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ traced_files: set[str] = field( default_factory=set, init=False ) files that are traced for compilation use_inductor_graph_partition class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ use_inductor_graph_partition: bool = Field(default=None) Use inductor graph partition to split the graph at cudagraph_unsafe ops. This partition happens at inductor codegen time after all passes and fusions are finished. It generates a single call function which wraps cudagraph-safe ops into partition functions and leave cudagraph-unsafe ops outside the partition functions. For a graph with N cudagraph-unsafe ops (e.g., Attention), there would be N+1 partitions. To mark an op as cudagraph unsafe, we can add tags=(torch._C.Tag.cudagraph_unsafe) when register the custom op. This config supports both full cudagraph and piecewise cudagraph without compiling twice. For piecewise cudagraph, it applies vLLM CUDAGraph wrapper to each partition. For N+1 partitions, there would be N+1 CUDAGraph wrapper instances. For full CUDAGraph, we always apply a single CUDAGraph wrapper outside the inductor call function in the model runner. The top-level full cudagraph capture ignores all partitioning. __post_init__ ¶ __post_init__() -> None Source code in vllm/config/compilation.py 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827 828 829 830def __post_init__(self) -> None: if self.level is not None: logger.warning( \"Level is deprecated and will be removed in the next release,\" \"either 0.12.0 or 0.11.2 whichever is soonest.\" \"Use mode instead.\" \"If both level and mode are given,\" \"only mode will be used.\" ) if self.mode is None: self.mode = self.level count_none = self.custom_ops.count(\"none\") count_all = self.custom_ops.count(\"all\") assert count_none + count_all <= 1, \"Can only specify 'none' or 'all'\" # TODO(zou3519/luka): There are 2 issues with auto-functionalization V2: # 1.

FULL mode: Capture full cudagraph for all batches. Can be good for small models or workloads with small prompts; not supported by many backends. Generally for performance FULL_AND_PIECEWISE is better. FULL_DECODE_ONLY mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches only. Mixed prefill-decode batches are run without cudagraphs. Can be good for decode instances in a P/D setup where prefill is not as important so we can save some memory. FULL_AND_PIECEWISE mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches and piecewise cudagraph for prefill and mixed prefill-decode batches. This is the most performant mode for most models and is the default. Currently, the cudagraph mode is only used for the v1 engine.

To mark an op as cudagraph unsafe, we can add `tags=(torch._C.Tag.cudagraph_unsafe)` when register the custom op. This config supports both full cudagraph and piecewise cudagraph without compiling twice. For piecewise cudagraph, it applies vLLM CUDAGraph wrapper to each partition.

We use string to avoid serialization issues when using compilation in a distributed setting. When the compilation mode is 1 or 2, the backend is used for the compilation directly (it sees the whole graph). When the compilation mode is 3, the backend supports both whole graph and piecewise compilation, available backends include eager, inductor, and custom backends, the latter of which can be defined via get_compile_backend. Furthermore, compilation is only piecewise if splitting ops is set accordingly and use_inductor_graph_partition is off. Note that the default options for splitting ops are sufficient for piecewise compilation. bs_to_padded_graph_size class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ bs_to_padded_graph_size: list[int] = field( default=None, init=False ) optimization: Intuitively, bs_to_padded_graph_size should be dict[int, int]. since we know all keys are in a range [0, max_cudagraph_capture_size], we can optimize it to list[int] for better lookup performance. cache_dir class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cache_dir: str = '' The directory to store the compiled graph, to accelerate Inductor compilation. By default, it will use model-related information to generate a cache directory. compilation_time class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compilation_time: float = field(default=0.0, init=False) time taken for compilation compile_cache_save_format class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compile_cache_save_format: Literal[\"binary\", \"unpacked\"] = ( field( default_factory=lambda: VLLM_COMPILE_CACHE_SAVE_FORMAT ) ) Format for saving torch compile cache: \"binary\": saves as binary file (multiprocess safe) \"unpacked\": saves as directory structure for inspection/debugging (NOT multiprocess safe) Defaults to VLLM_COMPILE_CACHE_SAVE_FORMAT if not specified. compile_mm_encoder class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compile_mm_encoder: bool = False Whether or not to compile the multimodal encoder. Currently, this only works for Qwen2_5_vl on selected platforms. Disabled by default until more models are supported/tested to work. compile_ranges_split_points class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compile_ranges_split_points: list[int] | None = None Split points that represent compile ranges for inductor. The compile ranges are [1, split_points[0]], [split_points[0] + 1, split_points[1]], ..., [split_points[-1] + 1, max_num_batched_tokens]. Compile sizes are also used single element ranges, the range is represented as [compile_sizes[i], compile_sizes[i]]. If a range overlaps with the compile size, graph for compile size will be prioritized, i.e. if we have a range [1, 8] and a compile size 4, graph for compile size 4 will be compiled and used instead of the graph for range [1, 8]. compile_sizes class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ compile_sizes: list[int | str] | None = None Sizes to compile for inductor. In addition to integers, it also supports \"cudagraph_capture_sizes\" to specify the sizes for cudagraph capture. cudagraph_capture_sizes class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_capture_sizes: list[int] | None = None Sizes to capture cudagraph. - None (default): capture sizes are inferred from vllm config. - list[int]: capture sizes are specified as given. cudagraph_copy_inputs class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_copy_inputs: bool = False Whether to copy input tensors for cudagraph. If the caller can guarantee that the same input buffers are always used, it can set this to False. Otherwise, it should set this to True, and the compiler will copy the input to an internally managed buffer. Default is False. Note that this flag is only effective when cudagraph_mode is PIECEWISE. cudagraph_mode class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_mode: CUDAGraphMode = Field(default=None) The mode of the cudagraph: NONE, no cudagraph capture. PIECEWISE. FULL. FULL_DECODE_ONLY. FULL_AND_PIECEWISE. (v1 default) PIECEWISE mode build piecewise cudagraph only, keeping the cudagraph incompatible ops (i.e. some attention ops) outside the cudagraph for general flexibility. FULL mode: Capture full cudagraph for all batches. Can be good for small models or workloads with small prompts; not supported by many backends. Generally for performance FULL_AND_PIECEWISE is better. FULL_DECODE_ONLY mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches only. Mixed prefill-decode batches are run without cudagraphs. Can be good for decode instances in a P/D setup where prefill is not as important so we can save some memory. FULL_AND_PIECEWISE mode: Capture full cudagraph for decode batches and piecewise cudagraph for prefill and mixed prefill-decode batches. This is the most performant mode for most models and is the default. Currently, the cudagraph mode is only used for the v1 engine. Note that the cudagraph logic is generally orthogonal to the compilation logic. While piecewise cudagraphs require piecewise compilation (mode=VLLM_COMPILE and non-empty splitting_ops), full cudagraphs are supported with and without compilation. Warning: This flag is new and subject to change in addition more modes may be added. cudagraph_num_of_warmups class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_num_of_warmups: int = 0 Number of warmup runs for cudagraph. It means the first several runs will be treated as warmup runs. Only after that, the execution will be recorded, and the recorded cudagraph will be used for subsequent runs. cudagraph_specialize_lora class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ cudagraph_specialize_lora: bool = True Whether to create separate cuda graphs for cases with and without active LoRA adapters. When set to False, the LoRA-enabled cuda graph will be used for all cases, incurring the overhead of running LoRA ops even when no adapters are active. Setting this to True will remove this overhead at the cost of increased startup time and slightly higher memory usage. When enable_lora is False, this option has no effect. custom_ops class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ custom_ops: list[str] = field(default_factory=list) Fine-grained control over which custom ops to enable/disable. Use 'all' to enable all, 'none' to disable all. Also specify a list of custom op names to enable (prefixed with a '+'), or disable (prefixed with a '-'). Examples: 'all,-op1' to enable all except op1 'none,+op1,+op2' to enable only op1 and op2 By default, all custom ops are enabled when running without Inductor and disabled when running with Inductor: mode>=VLLM_COMPILE and backend=\"inductor\". Inductor generates (fused) Triton kernels for disabled custom ops. debug_dump_path class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ debug_dump_path: Path | None = None The path to dump the debug information. disabled_custom_ops class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ disabled_custom_ops: Counter[str] = field( default_factory=Counter, init=False ) custom ops that are disabled dynamic_shapes_config class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ dynamic_shapes_config: DynamicShapesConfig = field( default_factory=DynamicShapesConfig ) Configuration for dynamic shapes options enabled_custom_ops class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ enabled_custom_ops: Counter[str] = field( default_factory=Counter, init=False ) custom ops that are enabled inductor_compile_config class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ inductor_compile_config: dict = field(default_factory=dict) Additional configurations for inductor. - None: use default configurations. inductor_passes class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ inductor_passes: dict[str, str] = field( default_factory=dict ) Additional passes for inductor. It is a dictionary from pass name to pass function qualified name. We use function name because the config uses JSON format. If we pass the config from Python, functions can also be passed directly via Python object constructor, e.g. CompilationConfig(inductor_passes={\"a\": func}). level class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ level: int = Field(default=None) Level is deprecated and will be removed in the next release, either 0.12.0 or 0.11.2 whichever is soonest. Please use mode. Currently all levels are mapped to mode. local_cache_dir class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ local_cache_dir: str = field(default=None, init=False) local cache dir for each rank max_cudagraph_capture_size class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ max_cudagraph_capture_size: int | None = field(default=None) The maximum cudagraph capture size. If cudagraph_capture_sizes is specified, this will be set to the largest size in that list (or checked for consistency if specified). If cudagraph_capture_sizes is not specified, the list of sizes is generated automatically following the pattern: [1, 2, 4] + list(range(8, 256, 8)) + list( range(256, max_cudagraph_capture_size + 1, 16)) If not specified, max_cudagraph_capture_size is set to min(max_num_seqs*2, 512) by default. This voids OOM in tight memory scenarios with small max_num_seqs, and prevents capture of many large graphs (>512) that would greatly increase startup time with limited performance benefit. mode class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ mode: CompilationMode = Field(default=None) The compilation approach used for torch.compile-based compilation of the model. None: If None, we will select the default compilation mode. For V1 engine this is 3. 0: NONE: No torch.compile compilation is applied, model runs in fully eager pytorch mode. The model runs as-is. 1: STOCK_TORCH_COMPILE: The standard torch.compile compilation pipeline. 2: DYNAMO_TRACE_ONCE: Single Dynamo trace through the model, avoiding recompilation by removing guards. Requires no dynamic-shape-dependent control-flow. 3: VLLM_COMPILE: Custom vLLM Inductor-based backend with caching, piecewise compilation, shape specialization, and custom passes. pass_config class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ pass_config: PassConfig = field(default_factory=PassConfig) Custom inductor passes, see PassConfig for more details splitting_ops class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ splitting_ops: list[str] | None = None A list of ops to exclude from cudagraphs, used in piecewise compilation. The behavior depends on use_inductor_graph_partition: When use_inductor_graph_partition=False (default): These ops are used for Dynamo FX-level graph splitting. The graph is split at these ops before Inductor compilation, creating separate subgraphs for cudagraph capture. When use_inductor_graph_partition=True: These ops are used to register Inductor partition rules. The graph partitioning happens at Inductor codegen time after all passes and fusions are finished, allowing compilation and custom passes to operate on the full graph while still excluding these ops from cudagraphs. If None, defaults to attention ops for piecewise cudagraphs. If empty list [], no ops are excluded (suitable for full cudagraphs). static_forward_context class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ static_forward_context: dict[str, Any] = field( default_factory=dict, init=False ) Per-model forward context Map from layer name to layer objects that need to be accessed outside model code, e.g., Attention, FusedMOE when dp_size>1. traced_files class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ traced_files: set[str] = field( default_factory=set, init=False ) files that are traced for compilation use_inductor_graph_partition class-attribute instance-attribute ¶ use_inductor_graph_partition: bool = Field(default=None) Use inductor graph partition to split the graph at cudagraph_unsafe ops. This partition happens at inductor codegen time after all passes and fusions are finished. It generates a single call function which wraps cudagraph-safe ops into partition functions and leave cudagraph-unsafe ops outside the partition functions. For a graph with N cudagraph-unsafe ops (e.g., Attention), there would be N+1 partitions. To mark an op as cudagraph unsafe, we can add tags=(torch._C.Tag.cudagraph_unsafe) when register the custom op. This config supports both full cudagraph and piecewise cudagraph without compiling twice. For piecewise cudagraph, it applies vLLM CUDAGraph wrapper to each partition. For N+1 partitions, there would be N+1 CUDAGraph wrapper instances. For full CUDAGraph, we always apply a single CUDAGraph wrapper outside the inductor call function in the model runner. The top-level full cudagraph capture ignores all partitioning. __post_init__ ¶ __post_init__() -> None Source code in vllm/config/compilation.py 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827 828 829 830def __post_init__(self) -> None: if self.level is not None: logger.warning( \"Level is deprecated and will be removed in the next release,\" \"either 0.12.0 or 0.11.2 whichever is soonest.\" \"Use mode instead.\" \"If both level and mode are given,\" \"only mode will be used.\" ) if self.mode is None: self.mode = self.level count_none = self.custom_ops.count(\"none\") count_all = self.custom_ops.count(\"all\") assert count_none + count_all <= 1, \"Can only specify 'none' or 'all'\" # TODO(zou3519/luka): There are 2 issues with auto-functionalization V2: # 1.
