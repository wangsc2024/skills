  "title": "Troubleshooting - vLLM",
  "content": "This document outlines some troubleshooting strategies you can consider. If you think you've discovered a bug, please search existing issues first to see if it has already been reported. If not, please file a new issue, providing as much relevant information as possible.\n\nOnce you've debugged a problem, remember to turn off any debugging environment variables defined, or simply start a new shell to avoid being affected by lingering debugging settings. Otherwise, the system might be slow with debugging functionalities left activated.\n\nIf the model isn't already downloaded to disk, vLLM will download it from the internet which can take time and depend on your internet connection. It's recommended to download the model first using the huggingface-cli and passing the local path to the model to vLLM. This way, you can isolate the issue.\n\nIf the model is large, it can take a long time to load it from disk. Pay attention to where you store the model. Some clusters have shared filesystems across nodes, e.g. a distributed filesystem or a network filesystem, which can be slow. It'd be better to store the model in a local disk. Additionally, have a look at the CPU memory usage, when the model is too large it might take a lot of CPU memory, slowing down the operating system because it needs to frequently swap between disk and memory.\n\nTo isolate the model downloading and loading issue, you can use the --load-format dummy argument to skip loading the model weights. This way, you can check if the model downloading and loading is the bottleneck.\n\nIf the model is too large to fit in a single GPU, you will get an out-of-memory (OOM) error. Consider adopting these options to reduce the memory consumption.\n\nIn v0.8.0, the source of default sampling parameters was changed in Pull Request #12622. Prior to v0.8.0, the default sampling parameters came from vLLM's set of neutral defaults. From v0.8.0 onwards, the default sampling parameters come from the generation_config.json provided by the model creator.\n\nIn most cases, this should lead to higher quality responses, because the model creator is likely to know which sampling parameters are best for their model. However, in some cases the defaults provided by the model creator can lead to degraded performance.\n\nYou can check if this is happening by trying the old defaults with --generation-config vllm for online and generation_config=\"vllm\" for offline. If, after trying this, your generation quality improves we would recommend continuing to use the vLLM defaults and petition the model creator on https://huggingface.co to update their default generation_config.json so that it produces better quality generations.\n\nIf other strategies don't solve the problem, it's likely that the vLLM instance is stuck somewhere. You can use the following environment variables to help debug the issue:\n\nSetting normal pdb breakpoints may not work in vLLM's codebase if they are executed in a subprocess. You will experience something like:\n\nOne solution is using forked-pdb. Install with pip install fpdb and set a breakpoint with something like:\n\nAnother option is to disable multiprocessing entirely, with the VLLM_ENABLE_V1_MULTIPROCESSING environment variable. This keeps the scheduler in the same process, so you can use stock pdb breakpoints:\n\nThe vLLM instance cannot get the correct IP address if you have a complicated network config. You can find a log such as DEBUG 06-10 21:32:17 parallel_state.py:88] world_size=8 rank=0 local_rank=0 distributed_init_method=tcp://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:54641 backend=nccl and the IP address should be the correct one. If it's not, override the IP address using the environment variable export VLLM_HOST_IP=<your_ip_address>.\n\nYou might also need to set export NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=<your_network_interface> and export GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME=<your_network_interface> to specify the network interface for the IP address.\n\nIf vLLM crashes and the error trace captures it somewhere around self.graph.replay() in vllm/worker/model_runner.py, it is a CUDA error inside CUDAGraph. To identify the particular CUDA operation that causes the error, you can add --enforce-eager to the command line, or enforce_eager=True to the LLM class to disable the CUDAGraph optimization and isolate the exact CUDA operation that causes the error.\n\nIf GPU/CPU communication cannot be established, you can use the following Python script and follow the instructions below to confirm whether the GPU/CPU communication is working correctly.\n\nIf you are testing with a single node, adjust --nproc-per-node to the number of GPUs you want to use:\n\nIf you are testing with multi-nodes, adjust --nproc-per-node and --nnodes according to your setup and set MASTER_ADDR to the correct IP address of the master node, reachable from all nodes. Then, run:\n\nIf the script runs successfully, you should see the message sanity check is successful!.\n\nIf the test script hangs or crashes, usually it means the hardware/drivers are broken in some sense. You should try to contact your system administrator or hardware vendor for further assistance. As a common workaround, you can try to tune some NCCL environment variables, such as export NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1 to see if it helps. Please check their documentation for more information. Please only use these environment variables as a temporary workaround, as they might affect the performance of the system. The best solution is still to fix the hardware/drivers so that the test script can run successfully.\n\nA multi-node environment is more complicated than a single-node one. If you see errors such as torch.distributed.DistNetworkError, it is likely that the network/DNS setup is incorrect. In that case, you can manually assign node rank and specify the IP via command line arguments:\n\nAdjust --nproc-per-node, --nnodes, and --node-rank according to your setup, being sure to execute different commands (with different --node-rank) on different nodes.\n\nIf you have seen a warning in your logs like this:\n\nor an error from Python that looks like this:\n\nthen you must update your Python code to guard usage of vllm behind a if __name__ == '__main__': block. For example, instead of this:\n\nvLLM heavily depends on torch.compile to optimize the model for better performance, which introduces the dependency on the torch.compile functionality and the triton library. By default, we use torch.compile to optimize some functions in the model. Before running vLLM, you can check if torch.compile is working as expected by running the following script:\n\nIf it raises errors from torch/_inductor directory, usually it means you have a custom triton library that is not compatible with the version of PyTorch you are using. See Issue #12219 for example.\n\nIf you see an error like:\n\nIt means that vLLM failed to import the model file. Usually, it is related to missing dependencies or outdated binaries in the vLLM build. Please read the logs carefully to determine the root cause of the error.\n\nIf you see an error like:\n\nBut you are sure that the model is in the list of supported models, there may be some issue with vLLM's model resolution. In that case, please follow these steps to explicitly specify the vLLM implementation for the model.\n\nIf you see an error like RuntimeError: Failed to infer device type, it means that vLLM failed to infer the device type of the runtime environment. You can check the code to see how vLLM infers the device type and why it is not working as expected. After this PR, you can also set the environment variable VLLM_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG to see more detailed logs to help debug the issue.\n\nIf your serving workload uses GPUDirect RDMA for distributed serving across multiple nodes and encounters an error during ncclCommInitRank, with no clear error message even with NCCL_DEBUG=INFO set, it might look like this:\n\nThis indicates vLLM failed to initialize the NCCL communicator, possibly due to a missing IPC_LOCK linux capability or an unmounted /dev/shm. Refer to Enabling GPUDirect RDMA for guidance on properly configuring the environment for GPUDirect RDMA.\n\nIf you see an error like RuntimeError: CUDA error: the provided PTX was compiled with an unsupported toolchain., it means that the CUDA PTX in vLLM's wheels was compiled with a toolchain unsupported by your system. The released vLLM wheels have to be compiled with a specific version of CUDA toolkit, and the compiled code might fail to run on lower versions of CUDA drivers. Read cuda compatibility for more details. The solution is to install cuda-compat package from your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run sudo apt-get install cuda-compat-12-9, and then add export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.9/compat:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH to your .bashrc file. When successfully installed, you should see that the output of nvidia-smi will show CUDA Version: 12.9. Note that we use CUDA 12.9 as an example here, you may want to install a higher version of cuda-compat package in case vLLM's default CUDA version goes higher.\n\nIf you use triton kernels with cuda 13, you might see an error like ptxas fatal: Value 'sm_110a' is not defined for option 'gpu-name':\n\nIt means that the ptxas in triton bundle not compatible with your device. You need to set TRITON_PTXAS_PATH environment variable to use cuda toolkit's ptxas manually instead:",
