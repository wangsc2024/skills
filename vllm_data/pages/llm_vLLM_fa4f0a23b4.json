  "content": "An LLM for generating texts from given prompts and sampling parameters.\n\nThis class includes a tokenizer, a language model (possibly distributed across multiple GPUs), and GPU memory space allocated for intermediate states (aka KV cache). Given a batch of prompts and sampling parameters, this class generates texts from the model, using an intelligent batching mechanism and efficient memory management.\n\nThe name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers model.\n\nThe name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers tokenizer.\n\nThe tokenizer mode. \"auto\" will use the fast tokenizer if available, and \"slow\" will always use the slow tokenizer.\n\nIf true, skip initialization of tokenizer and detokenizer. Expect valid prompt_token_ids and None for prompt from the input.\n\nTrust remote code (e.g., from HuggingFace) when downloading the model and tokenizer.\n\nAllowing API requests to read local images or videos from directories specified by the server file system. This is a security risk. Should only be enabled in trusted environments.\n\nIf set, only media URLs that belong to this domain can be used for multi-modal inputs.\n\nThe number of GPUs to use for distributed execution with tensor parallelism.\n\nThe data type for the model weights and activations. Currently, we support float32, float16, and bfloat16. If auto, we use the dtype attribute of the Transformers model's config. However, if the dtype in the config is float32, we will use float16 instead.\n\nThe method used to quantize the model weights. Currently, we support \"awq\", \"gptq\", and \"fp8\" (experimental). If None, we first check the quantization_config attribute in the model config file. If that is None, we assume the model weights are not quantized and use dtype to determine the data type of the weights.\n\nThe specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id.\n\nThe specific tokenizer version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id.\n\nThe seed to initialize the random number generator for sampling.\n\nThe ratio (between 0 and 1) of GPU memory to reserve for the model weights, activations, and KV cache. Higher values will increase the KV cache size and thus improve the model's throughput. However, if the value is too high, it may cause out-of- memory (OOM) errors.\n\nSize of KV Cache per GPU in bytes. By default, this is set to None and vllm can automatically infer the kv cache size based on gpu_memory_utilization. However, users may want to manually specify the kv cache memory size. kv_cache_memory_bytes allows more fine-grain control of how much memory gets used when compared with using gpu_memory_utilization. Note that kv_cache_memory_bytes (when not-None) ignores gpu_memory_utilization\n\nThe size (GiB) of CPU memory per GPU to use as swap space. This can be used for temporarily storing the states of the requests when their best_of sampling parameters are larger than 1. If all requests will have best_of=1, you can safely set this to 0. Noting that best_of is only supported in V0. Otherwise, too small values may cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors.\n\nThe size (GiB) of CPU memory to use for offloading the model weights. This virtually increases the GPU memory space you can use to hold the model weights, at the cost of CPU-GPU data transfer for every forward pass.\n\nWhether to enforce eager execution. If True, we will disable CUDA graph and always execute the model in eager mode. If False, we will use CUDA graph and eager execution in hybrid.\n\nThe token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files . If True, will use the token generated when running huggingface-cli login (stored in ~/.huggingface).\n\nIf a dictionary, contains arguments to be forwarded to the HuggingFace config. If a callable, it is called to update the HuggingFace config.\n\nArguments to be forwarded to the model's processor for multi-modal data, e.g., image processor. Overrides for the multi-modal processor obtained from AutoProcessor.from_pretrained. The available overrides depend on the model that is being run. For example, for Phi-3-Vision: {\"num_crops\": 4}.\n\nInitialize non-default pooling config for the pooling model. e.g. PoolerConfig(pooling_type=\"mean\", normalize=False).\n\nEither an integer or a dictionary. If it is an integer, it is used as the mode of compilation optimization. If it is a dictionary, it can specify the full compilation configuration.\n\nConfiguration for attention mechanisms. Can be a dictionary or an AttentionConfig instance. If a dictionary, it will be converted to an AttentionConfig. Allows specifying the attention backend and other attention-related settings.\n\nArguments for EngineArgs.\n\nThis class is intended to be used for offline inference. For online serving, use the AsyncLLMEngine class instead.\n\nGet the optional lora request corresponding to each prompt.\n\nUse the Processor to process inputs for LLMEngine.\n\nValidate that if any multi-modal data is skipped (i.e. None), then its corresponding UUID must be set.\n\nRun a function directly on the model inside each worker, returning the result for each of them.\n\nTo reduce the overhead of data transfer, avoid returning large arrays or tensors from this method. If you must return them, make sure you move them to CPU first to avoid taking up additional VRAM!\n\nGenerate sequences using beam search.\n\nA list of prompts. Each prompt can be a string or a list of token IDs.\n\nThe beam search parameters.\n\nLoRA request to use for generation, if any.\n\nWhether to use tqdm to display the progress bar.\n\nThe maximum number of concurrent requests. If None, the number of concurrent requests is unlimited.\n\nGenerate responses for a chat conversation.\n\nThe chat conversation is converted into a text prompt using the tokenizer and calls the generate method to generate the responses.\n\nMulti-modal inputs can be passed in the same way you would pass them to the OpenAI API.\n\nA list of conversations or a single conversation.\n\nThe sampling parameters for text generation. If None, we use the default sampling parameters. When it is a single value, it is applied to every prompt. When it is a list, the list must have the same length as the prompts and it is paired one by one with the prompt.\n\nIf True, shows a tqdm progress bar. If a callable (e.g., functools.partial(tqdm, leave=False)), it is used to create the progress bar. If False, no progress bar is created.\n\nLoRA request to use for generation, if any.\n\nThe template to use for structuring the chat. If not provided, the model's default chat template will be used.\n\nThe format to render message content.\n\nIf True, adds a generation template to each message.\n\nIf True, continues the final message in the conversation instead of starting a new one. Cannot be True if add_generation_prompt is also True.\n\nAdditional kwargs to pass to the chat template.\n\nMultimodal processor kwarg overrides for this chat request. Only used for offline requests.\n\nA list of RequestOutput objects containing the generated\n\nresponses in the same order as the input messages.\n\nGenerate class logits for each prompt.\n\nThis class automatically batches the given prompts, considering the memory constraint. For the best performance, put all of your prompts into a single list and pass it to this method.\n\nThe prompts to the LLM. You may pass a sequence of prompts for batch inference. See PromptType for more details about the format of each prompt.\n\nIf True, shows a tqdm progress bar.

If None, we use the default pooling parameters.\n\nReturns: A list of ClassificationRequestOutput objects containing the embedding vectors in the same order as the input prompts.\n\nExecute an RPC call on all workers.\n\nName of the worker method to execute, or a callable that is serialized and sent to all workers to execute.\n\nIf the method is a callable, it should accept an additional self argument, in addition to the arguments passed in args and kwargs. The self argument will be the worker object.\n\nMaximum time in seconds to wait for execution. Raises a TimeoutError on timeout. None means wait indefinitely.\n\nPositional arguments to pass to the worker method.\n\nKeyword arguments to pass to the worker method.\n\nA list containing the results from each worker.\n\nIt is recommended to use this API to only pass control messages, and set up data-plane communication to pass data.\n\nGenerate an embedding vector for each prompt.\n\nThis class automatically batches the given prompts, considering the memory constraint. For the best performance, put all of your prompts into a single list and pass it to this method.\n\nThe prompts to the LLM. You may pass a sequence of prompts for batch inference. See PromptType for more details about the format of each prompt.\n\nThe pooling parameters for pooling. If None, we use the default pooling parameters.\n\nIf True, shows a tqdm progress bar.

In the 1 - N case the data_1 input will be replicated N times to pair with the data_2 inputs. The input pairs are used to build a list of prompts for the cross encoder model. This class automatically batches the prompts, considering the memory constraint. For the best performance, put all of your inputs into a single list and pass it to this method.\n\nSupports both text and multi-modal data (images, etc.) when used with appropriate multi-modal models. For multi-modal inputs, ensure the prompt structure matches the model's expected input format.\n\nCan be a single prompt, a list of prompts or ScoreMultiModalParam, which can contain either text or multi-modal data.

See PromptType for more details about the format of each prompt.\n\nIf True, shows a tqdm progress bar. If a callable (e.g., functools.partial(tqdm, leave=False)), it is used to create the progress bar. If False, no progress bar is created.\n\nLoRA request to use for generation, if any.\n\nThe pooling parameters for pooling. If None, we use the default pooling parameters.\n\nThe chat template to use for the scoring. If None, we use the model's default chat template.\n\nReturns: A list of ScoringRequestOutput objects containing the generated scores in the same order as the input prompts.\n\nPut the engine to sleep. The engine should not process any requests. The caller should guarantee that no requests are being processed during the sleep period, before wake_up is called.\n\nThe sleep level. Level 1 sleep will offload the model weights and discard the kv cache. The content of kv cache is forgotten. Level 1 sleep is good for sleeping and waking up the engine to run the same model again. The model weights are backed up in CPU memory. Please make sure there's enough CPU memory to store the model weights. Level 2 sleep will discard both the model weights and the kv cache. The content of both the model weights and kv cache is forgotten. Level 2 sleep is good for sleeping and waking up the engine to run a different model or update the model, where previous model weights are not needed. It reduces CPU memory pressure.\n\nWake up the engine from sleep mode. See the sleep method for more details.\n\nAn optional list of tags to reallocate the engine memory for specific memory allocations. Values must be in (\"weights\", \"kv_cache\"). If None, all memory is reallocated. wake_up should be called with all tags (or None) before the engine is used again.",

    {
      "code": "class LLM:\n    \"\"\"An LLM for generating texts from given prompts and sampling parameters.\n\n    This class includes a tokenizer, a language model (possibly distributed\n    across multiple GPUs), and GPU memory space allocated for intermediate\n    states (aka KV cache). Given a batch of prompts and sampling parameters,\n    this class generates texts from the model, using an intelligent batching\n    mechanism and efficient memory management.\n\n    Args:\n        model: The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers model.\n        tokenizer: The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers tokenizer.\n        tokenizer_mode: The tokenizer mode. \"auto\" will use the fast tokenizer\n            if available, and \"slow\" will always use the slow tokenizer.\n        skip_tokenizer_init: If true, skip initialization of tokenizer and\n            detokenizer. Expect valid prompt_token_ids and None for prompt\n            from the input.\n        trust_remote_code: Trust remote code (e.g., from HuggingFace) when\n            downloading the model and tokenizer.\n        allowed_local_media_path: Allowing API requests to read local images\n            or videos from directories specified by the server file system.\n            This is a security risk. Should only be enabled in trusted\n            environments.\n        allowed_media_domains: If set, only media URLs that belong to this\n            domain can be used for multi-modal inputs.\n        tensor_parallel_size: The number of GPUs to use for distributed\n            execution with tensor parallelism.\n        dtype: The data type for the model weights and activations. Currently,\n            we support `float32`, `float16`, and `bfloat16`. If `auto`, we use\n            the `dtype` attribute of the Transformers model's config. However,\n            if the `dtype` in the config is `float32`, we will use `float16` instead.\n        quantization: The method used to quantize the model weights. Currently,\n            we support \"awq\", \"gptq\", and \"fp8\" (experimental).\n            If None, we first check the `quantization_config` attribute in the\n            model config file. If that is None, we assume the model weights are\n            not quantized and use `dtype` to determine the data type of\n            the weights.\n        revision: The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name,\n            a tag name, or a commit id.\n        tokenizer_revision: The specific tokenizer version to use. It can be a\n            branch name, a tag name, or a commit id.\n        seed: The seed to initialize the random number generator for sampling.\n        gpu_memory_utilization: The ratio (between 0 and 1) of GPU memory to\n            reserve for the model weights, activations, and KV cache. Higher\n            values will increase the KV cache size and thus improve the model's\n            throughput. However, if the value is too high, it may cause out-of-\n            memory (OOM) errors.\n        kv_cache_memory_bytes: Size of KV Cache per GPU in bytes. By default,\n            this is set to None and vllm can automatically infer the kv cache\n            size based on gpu_memory_utilization. However, users may want to\n            manually specify the kv cache memory size. kv_cache_memory_bytes\n            allows more fine-grain control of how much memory gets used when\n            compared with using gpu_memory_utilization. Note that\n            kv_cache_memory_bytes (when not-None) ignores\n            gpu_memory_utilization\n        swap_space: The size (GiB) of CPU memory per GPU to use as swap space.\n            This can be used for temporarily storing the states of the requests\n            when their `best_of` sampling parameters are larger than 1. If all\n            requests will have `best_of=1`, you can safely set this to 0.\n            Noting that `best_of` is only supported in V0. Otherwise, too small\n            values may cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors.\n        cpu_offload_gb: The size (GiB) of CPU memory to use for offloading\n            the model weights. This virtually increases the GPU memory space\n            you can use to hold the model weights, at the cost of CPU-GPU data\n            transfer for every forward pass.\n        enforce_eager: Whether to enforce eager execution. If True, we will\n            disable CUDA graph and always execute the model in eager mode.\n            If False, we will use CUDA graph and eager execution in hybrid.\n        disable_custom_all_reduce: See\n            [ParallelConfig][vllm.config.ParallelConfig].\n        hf_token: The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files\n            . If `True`, will use the token generated when running\n            `huggingface-cli login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`).\n        hf_overrides: If a dictionary, contains arguments to be forwarded to the\n            HuggingFace config. If a callable, it is called to update the\n            HuggingFace config.\n        mm_processor_kwargs: Arguments to be forwarded to the model's processor\n            for multi-modal data, e.g., image processor. Overrides for the\n            multi-modal processor obtained from `AutoProcessor.from_pretrained`.\n            The available overrides depend on the model that is being run.\n            For example, for Phi-3-Vision: `{\"num_crops\": 4}`.\n        pooler_config: Initialize non-default pooling config for the pooling\n            model. e.g. `PoolerConfig(pooling_type=\"mean\", normalize=False)`.\n        compilation_config: Either an integer or a dictionary. If it is an\n            integer, it is used as the mode of compilation optimization. If it\n            is a dictionary, it can specify the full compilation configuration.\n        attention_config: Configuration for attention mechanisms.

      "code": "class LLM:\n    \"\"\"An LLM for generating texts from given prompts and sampling parameters.\n\n    This class includes a tokenizer, a language model (possibly distributed\n    across multiple GPUs), and GPU memory space allocated for intermediate\n    states (aka KV cache). Given a batch of prompts and sampling parameters,\n    this class generates texts from the model, using an intelligent batching\n    mechanism and efficient memory management.\n\n    Args:\n        model: The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers model.\n        tokenizer: The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers tokenizer.\n        tokenizer_mode: The tokenizer mode. \"auto\" will use the fast tokenizer\n            if available, and \"slow\" will always use the slow tokenizer.\n        skip_tokenizer_init: If true, skip initialization of tokenizer and\n            detokenizer. Expect valid prompt_token_ids and None for prompt\n            from the input.\n        trust_remote_code: Trust remote code (e.g., from HuggingFace) when\n            downloading the model and tokenizer.\n        allowed_local_media_path: Allowing API requests to read local images\n            or videos from directories specified by the server file system.\n            This is a security risk. Should only be enabled in trusted\n            environments.\n        allowed_media_domains: If set, only media URLs that belong to this\n            domain can be used for multi-modal inputs.\n        tensor_parallel_size: The number of GPUs to use for distributed\n            execution with tensor parallelism.\n        dtype: The data type for the model weights and activations. Currently,\n            we support `float32`, `float16`, and `bfloat16`. If `auto`, we use\n            the `dtype` attribute of the Transformers model's config. However,\n            if the `dtype` in the config is `float32`, we will use `float16` instead.\n        quantization: The method used to quantize the model weights. Currently,\n            we support \"awq\", \"gptq\", and \"fp8\" (experimental).\n            If None, we first check the `quantization_config` attribute in the\n            model config file. If that is None, we assume the model weights are\n            not quantized and use `dtype` to determine the data type of\n            the weights.\n        revision: The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name,\n            a tag name, or a commit id.\n        tokenizer_revision: The specific tokenizer version to use. It can be a\n            branch name, a tag name, or a commit id.\n        seed: The seed to initialize the random number generator for sampling.\n        gpu_memory_utilization: The ratio (between 0 and 1) of GPU memory to\n            reserve for the model weights, activations, and KV cache. Higher\n            values will increase the KV cache size and thus improve the model's\n            throughput. However, if the value is too high, it may cause out-of-\n            memory (OOM) errors.\n        kv_cache_memory_bytes: Size of KV Cache per GPU in bytes. By default,\n            this is set to None and vllm can automatically infer the kv cache\n            size based on gpu_memory_utilization. However, users may want to\n            manually specify the kv cache memory size. kv_cache_memory_bytes\n            allows more fine-grain control of how much memory gets used when\n            compared with using gpu_memory_utilization. Note that\n            kv_cache_memory_bytes (when not-None) ignores\n            gpu_memory_utilization\n        swap_space: The size (GiB) of CPU memory per GPU to use as swap space.\n            This can be used for temporarily storing the states of the requests\n            when their `best_of` sampling parameters are larger than 1. If all\n            requests will have `best_of=1`, you can safely set this to 0.\n            Noting that `best_of` is only supported in V0. Otherwise, too small\n            values may cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors.\n        cpu_offload_gb: The size (GiB) of CPU memory to use for offloading\n            the model weights. This virtually increases the GPU memory space\n            you can use to hold the model weights, at the cost of CPU-GPU data\n            transfer for every forward pass.\n        enforce_eager: Whether to enforce eager execution. If True, we will\n            disable CUDA graph and always execute the model in eager mode.\n            If False, we will use CUDA graph and eager execution in hybrid.\n        disable_custom_all_reduce: See\n            [ParallelConfig][vllm.config.ParallelConfig].\n        hf_token: The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files\n            . If `True`, will use the token generated when running\n            `huggingface-cli login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`).\n        hf_overrides: If a dictionary, contains arguments to be forwarded to the\n            HuggingFace config. If a callable, it is called to update the\n            HuggingFace config.\n        mm_processor_kwargs: Arguments to be forwarded to the model's processor\n            for multi-modal data, e.g., image processor. Overrides for the\n            multi-modal processor obtained from `AutoProcessor.from_pretrained`.\n            The available overrides depend on the model that is being run.\n            For example, for Phi-3-Vision: `{\"num_crops\": 4}`.\n        pooler_config: Initialize non-default pooling config for the pooling\n            model. e.g. `PoolerConfig(pooling_type=\"mean\", normalize=False)`.\n        compilation_config: Either an integer or a dictionary. If it is an\n            integer, it is used as the mode of compilation optimization. If it\n            is a dictionary, it can specify the full compilation configuration.\n        attention_config: Configuration for attention mechanisms. Can be a\n            dictionary or an AttentionConfig instance. If a dictionary, it will\n            be converted to an AttentionConfig. Allows specifying the attention\n            backend and other attention-related settings.\n        **kwargs: Arguments for [`EngineArgs`][vllm.EngineArgs].\n\n    Note:\n        This class is intended to be used for offline inference.

prompts and sampling parameters. This class includes a tokenizer, a language model (possibly distributed across multiple GPUs), and GPU memory space allocated for intermediate states (aka KV cache). Given a batch of prompts and sampling parameters, this class generates texts from the model, using an intelligent batching mechanism and efficient memory management. Parameters: Name Type Description Default model str The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers model. required tokenizer str | None The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers tokenizer. None tokenizer_mode TokenizerMode | str The tokenizer mode. \"auto\" will use the fast tokenizer if available, and \"slow\" will always use the slow tokenizer. 'auto' skip_tokenizer_init bool If true, skip initialization of tokenizer and detokenizer. Expect valid prompt_token_ids and None for prompt from the input. False trust_remote_code bool Trust remote code (e.g., from HuggingFace) when downloading the model and tokenizer. False allowed_local_media_path str Allowing API requests to read local images or videos from directories specified by the server file system. This is a security risk. Should only be enabled in trusted environments. '' allowed_media_domains list[str] | None If set, only media URLs that belong to this domain can be used for multi-modal inputs. None tensor_parallel_size int The number of GPUs to use for distributed execution with tensor parallelism. 1 dtype ModelDType The data type for the model weights and activations. Currently, we support float32, float16, and bfloat16. If auto, we use the dtype attribute of the Transformers model's config. However, if the dtype in the config is float32, we will use float16 instead. 'auto' quantization QuantizationMethods | None The method used to quantize the model weights. Currently, we support \"awq\", \"gptq\", and \"fp8\" (experimental). If None, we first check the quantization_config attribute in the model config file. If that is None, we assume the model weights are not quantized and use dtype to determine the data type of the weights. None revision str | None The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. None tokenizer_revision str | None The specific tokenizer version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. None seed int The seed to initialize the random number generator for sampling. 0 gpu_memory_utilization float The ratio (between 0 and 1) of GPU memory to reserve for the model weights, activations, and KV cache. Higher values will increase the KV cache size and thus improve the model's throughput. However, if the value is too high, it may cause out-of- memory (OOM) errors. 0.9 kv_cache_memory_bytes int | None Size of KV Cache per GPU in bytes. By default, this is set to None and vllm can automatically infer the kv cache size based on gpu_memory_utilization. However, users may want to manually specify the kv cache memory size. kv_cache_memory_bytes allows more fine-grain control of how much memory gets used when compared with using gpu_memory_utilization. Note that kv_cache_memory_bytes (when not-None) ignores gpu_memory_utilization None swap_space float The size (GiB) of CPU memory per GPU to use as swap space. This can be used for temporarily storing the states of the requests when their best_of sampling parameters are larger than 1. If all requests will have best_of=1, you can safely set this to 0. Noting that best_of is only supported in V0. Otherwise, too small values may cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors. 4 cpu_offload_gb float The size (GiB) of CPU memory to use for offloading the model weights. This virtually increases the GPU memory space you can use to hold the model weights, at the cost of CPU-GPU data transfer for every forward pass. 0 enforce_eager bool Whether to enforce eager execution. If True, we will disable CUDA graph and always execute the model in eager mode. If False, we will use CUDA graph and eager execution in hybrid. False disable_custom_all_reduce bool See ParallelConfig. False hf_token bool | str | None The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files . If True, will use the token generated when running huggingface-cli login (stored in ~/.huggingface). None hf_overrides HfOverrides | None If a dictionary, contains arguments to be forwarded to the HuggingFace config. If a callable, it is called to update the HuggingFace config. None mm_processor_kwargs dict[str, Any] | None Arguments to be forwarded to the model's processor for multi-modal data, e.g., image processor. Overrides for the multi-modal processor obtained from AutoProcessor.from_pretrained. The available overrides depend on the model that is being run. For example, for Phi-3-Vision: {\"num_crops\": 4}. None pooler_config PoolerConfig | None Initialize non-default pooling config for the pooling model. e.g. PoolerConfig(pooling_type=\"mean\", normalize=False). None compilation_config int | dict[str, Any] | CompilationConfig | None Either an integer or a dictionary. If it is an integer, it is used as the mode of compilation optimization. If it is a dictionary, it can specify the full compilation configuration. None attention_config dict[str, Any] | AttentionConfig | None Configuration for attention mechanisms. Can be a dictionary or an AttentionConfig instance. If a dictionary, it will be converted to an AttentionConfig. Allows specifying the attention backend and other attention-related settings. None **kwargs Any Arguments for EngineArgs. {} Note This class is intended to be used for offline inference. For online serving, use the AsyncLLMEngine class instead.

1788class LLM: \"\"\"An LLM for generating texts from given prompts and sampling parameters. This class includes a tokenizer, a language model (possibly distributed across multiple GPUs), and GPU memory space allocated for intermediate states (aka KV cache). Given a batch of prompts and sampling parameters, this class generates texts from the model, using an intelligent batching mechanism and efficient memory management. Args: model: The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers model. tokenizer: The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers tokenizer. tokenizer_mode: The tokenizer mode. \"auto\" will use the fast tokenizer if available, and \"slow\" will always use the slow tokenizer. skip_tokenizer_init: If true, skip initialization of tokenizer and detokenizer. Expect valid prompt_token_ids and None for prompt from the input. trust_remote_code: Trust remote code (e.g., from HuggingFace) when downloading the model and tokenizer. allowed_local_media_path: Allowing API requests to read local images or videos from directories specified by the server file system. This is a security risk. Should only be enabled in trusted environments. allowed_media_domains: If set, only media URLs that belong to this domain can be used for multi-modal inputs. tensor_parallel_size: The number of GPUs to use for distributed execution with tensor parallelism. dtype: The data type for the model weights and activations. Currently, we support `float32`, `float16`, and `bfloat16`. If `auto`, we use the `dtype` attribute of the Transformers model's config. However, if the `dtype` in the config is `float32`, we will use `float16` instead. quantization: The method used to quantize the model weights. Currently, we support \"awq\", \"gptq\", and \"fp8\" (experimental). If None, we first check the `quantization_config` attribute in the model config file. If that is None, we assume the model weights are not quantized and use `dtype` to determine the data type of the weights. revision: The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. tokenizer_revision: The specific tokenizer version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. seed: The seed to initialize the random number generator for sampling. gpu_memory_utilization: The ratio (between 0 and 1) of GPU memory to reserve for the model weights, activations, and KV cache. Higher values will increase the KV cache size and thus improve the model's throughput. However, if the value is too high, it may cause out-of- memory (OOM) errors. kv_cache_memory_bytes: Size of KV Cache per GPU in bytes. By default, this is set to None and vllm can automatically infer the kv cache size based on gpu_memory_utilization. However, users may want to manually specify the kv cache memory size. kv_cache_memory_bytes allows more fine-grain control of how much memory gets used when compared with using gpu_memory_utilization. Note that kv_cache_memory_bytes (when not-None) ignores gpu_memory_utilization swap_space: The size (GiB) of CPU memory per GPU to use as swap space. This can be used for temporarily storing the states of the requests when their `best_of` sampling parameters are larger than 1. If all requests will have `best_of=1`, you can safely set this to 0. Noting that `best_of` is only supported in V0. Otherwise, too small values may cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors. cpu_offload_gb: The size (GiB) of CPU memory to use for offloading the model weights. This virtually increases the GPU memory space you can use to hold the model weights, at the cost of CPU-GPU data transfer for every forward pass. enforce_eager: Whether to enforce eager execution. If True, we will disable CUDA graph and always execute the model in eager mode. If False, we will use CUDA graph and eager execution in hybrid. disable_custom_all_reduce: See [ParallelConfig][vllm.config.ParallelConfig]. hf_token: The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files . If `True`, will use the token generated when running `huggingface-cli login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`). hf_overrides: If a dictionary, contains arguments to be forwarded to the HuggingFace config. If a callable, it is called to update the HuggingFace config. mm_processor_kwargs: Arguments to be forwarded to the model's processor for multi-modal data, e.g., image processor. Overrides for the multi-modal processor obtained from `AutoProcessor.from_pretrained`. The available overrides depend on the model that is being run. For example, for Phi-3-Vision: `{\"num_crops\": 4}`. pooler_config: Initialize non-default pooling config for the pooling model. e.g. `PoolerConfig(pooling_type=\"mean\", normalize=False)`. compilation_config: Either an integer or a dictionary. If it is an integer, it is used as the mode of compilation optimization. If it is a dictionary, it can specify the full compilation configuration. attention_config: Configuration for attention mechanisms. Can be a dictionary or an AttentionConfig instance. If a dictionary, it will be converted to an AttentionConfig. Allows specifying the attention backend and other attention-related settings. **kwargs: Arguments for [`EngineArgs`][vllm.EngineArgs]. Note: This class is intended to be used for offline inference. For online serving, use the [AsyncLLMEngine][vllm.AsyncLLMEngine] class instead. \"\"\" def __init__( self, model: str, *, runner: RunnerOption = \"auto\", convert: ConvertOption = \"auto\", tokenizer: str | None = None, tokenizer_mode: TokenizerMode | str = \"auto\", skip_tokenizer_init: bool = False, trust_remote_code: bool = False, allowed_local_media_path: str = \"\", allowed_media_domains: list[str] | None = None, tensor_parallel_size: int = 1, dtype: ModelDType = \"auto\", quantization: QuantizationMethods | None = None, revision: str | None = None, tokenizer_revision: str | None = None, seed: int = 0, gpu_memory_utilization: float = 0.9, swap_space: float = 4, cpu_offload_gb: float = 0, enforce_eager: bool = False, disable_custom_all_reduce: bool = False, hf_token: bool | str | None = None, hf_overrides: HfOverrides | None = None, mm_processor_kwargs: dict[str, Any] | None = None, pooler_config: PoolerConfig | None = None, structured_outputs_config: dict[str, Any] | StructuredOutputsConfig | None = None, profiler_config: dict[str, Any] | ProfilerConfig | None = None, attention_config: dict[str, Any] | AttentionConfig | None = None, kv_cache_memory_bytes: int | None = None, compilation_config: int | dict[str, Any] | CompilationConfig | None = None, logits_processors: list[str | type[LogitsProcessor]] | None = None, **kwargs: Any, ) -> None: \"\"\"LLM constructor.\"\"\" if \"disable_log_stats\" not in kwargs: kwargs[\"disable_log_stats\"] = True if \"worker_cls\" in kwargs: worker_cls = kwargs[\"worker_cls\"] # if the worker_cls is not qualified string name, # we serialize it using cloudpickle to avoid pickling issues if isinstance(worker_cls, type): kwargs[\"worker_cls\"] = cloudpickle.dumps(worker_cls) if \"kv_transfer_config\" in kwargs and isinstance( kwargs[\"kv_transfer_config\"], dict ): from vllm.config.kv_transfer import KVTransferConfig raw_config_dict = kwargs[\"kv_transfer_config\"] try: kwargs[\"kv_transfer_config\"] = KVTransferConfig(**raw_config_dict) except ValidationError as e: logger.error( \"Failed to convert 'kv_transfer_config' dict to \" \"KVTransferConfig object.

      "description": "vllm.entrypoints.llm ¶ _R module-attribute ¶ _R = TypeVar('_R', default=Any) logger module-attribute ¶ logger = init_logger(__name__) LLM ¶ An LLM for generating texts from given prompts and sampling parameters. This class includes a tokenizer, a language model (possibly distributed across multiple GPUs), and GPU memory space allocated for intermediate states (aka KV cache). Given a batch of prompts and sampling parameters, this class generates texts from the model, using an intelligent batching mechanism and efficient memory management. Parameters: Name Type Description Default model str The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers model. required tokenizer str | None The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers tokenizer. None tokenizer_mode TokenizerMode | str The tokenizer mode. \"auto\" will use the fast tokenizer if available, and \"slow\" will always use the slow tokenizer. 'auto' skip_tokenizer_init bool If true, skip initialization of tokenizer and detokenizer. Expect valid prompt_token_ids and None for prompt from the input. False trust_remote_code bool Trust remote code (e.g., from HuggingFace) when downloading the model and tokenizer. False allowed_local_media_path str Allowing API requests to read local images or videos from directories specified by the server file system. This is a security risk. Should only be enabled in trusted environments. '' allowed_media_domains list[str] | None If set, only media URLs that belong to this domain can be used for multi-modal inputs. None tensor_parallel_size int The number of GPUs to use for distributed execution with tensor parallelism. 1 dtype ModelDType The data type for the model weights and activations. Currently, we support float32, float16, and bfloat16. If auto, we use the dtype attribute of the Transformers model's config. However, if the dtype in the config is float32, we will use float16 instead. 'auto' quantization QuantizationMethods | None The method used to quantize the model weights. Currently, we support \"awq\", \"gptq\", and \"fp8\" (experimental). If None, we first check the quantization_config attribute in the model config file. If that is None, we assume the model weights are not quantized and use dtype to determine the data type of the weights. None revision str | None The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. None tokenizer_revision str | None The specific tokenizer version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. None seed int The seed to initialize the random number generator for sampling. 0 gpu_memory_utilization float The ratio (between 0 and 1) of GPU memory to reserve for the model weights, activations, and KV cache. Higher values will increase the KV cache size and thus improve the model's throughput. However, if the value is too high, it may cause out-of- memory (OOM) errors. 0.9 kv_cache_memory_bytes int | None Size of KV Cache per GPU in bytes. By default, this is set to None and vllm can automatically infer the kv cache size based on gpu_memory_utilization. However, users may want to manually specify the kv cache memory size. kv_cache_memory_bytes allows more fine-grain control of how much memory gets used when compared with using gpu_memory_utilization. Note that kv_cache_memory_bytes (when not-None) ignores gpu_memory_utilization None swap_space float The size (GiB) of CPU memory per GPU to use as swap space. This can be used for temporarily storing the states of the requests when their best_of sampling parameters are larger than 1. If all requests will have best_of=1, you can safely set this to 0. Noting that best_of is only supported in V0. Otherwise, too small values may cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors. 4 cpu_offload_gb float The size (GiB) of CPU memory to use for offloading the model weights. This virtually increases the GPU memory space you can use to hold the model weights, at the cost of CPU-GPU data transfer for every forward pass. 0 enforce_eager bool Whether to enforce eager execution. If True, we will disable CUDA graph and always execute the model in eager mode. If False, we will use CUDA graph and eager execution in hybrid. False disable_custom_all_reduce bool See ParallelConfig. False hf_token bool | str | None The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files . If True, will use the token generated when running huggingface-cli login (stored in ~/.huggingface). None hf_overrides HfOverrides | None If a dictionary, contains arguments to be forwarded to the HuggingFace config. If a callable, it is called to update the HuggingFace config. None mm_processor_kwargs dict[str, Any] | None Arguments to be forwarded to the model's processor for multi-modal data, e.g., image processor. Overrides for the multi-modal processor obtained from AutoProcessor.from_pretrained. The available overrides depend on the model that is being run. For example, for Phi-3-Vision: {\"num_crops\": 4}. None pooler_config PoolerConfig | None Initialize non-default pooling config for the pooling model. e.g. PoolerConfig(pooling_type=\"mean\", normalize=False). None compilation_config int | dict[str, Any] | CompilationConfig | None Either an integer or a dictionary. If it is an integer, it is used as the mode of compilation optimization. If it is a dictionary, it can specify the full compilation configuration. None attention_config dict[str, Any] | AttentionConfig | None Configuration for attention mechanisms. Can be a dictionary or an AttentionConfig instance. If a dictionary, it will be converted to an AttentionConfig. Allows specifying the attention backend and other attention-related settings. None **kwargs Any Arguments for EngineArgs. {} Note This class is intended to be used for offline inference. For online serving, use the AsyncLLMEngine class instead.

1788class LLM: \"\"\"An LLM for generating texts from given prompts and sampling parameters. This class includes a tokenizer, a language model (possibly distributed across multiple GPUs), and GPU memory space allocated for intermediate states (aka KV cache). Given a batch of prompts and sampling parameters, this class generates texts from the model, using an intelligent batching mechanism and efficient memory management. Args: model: The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers model. tokenizer: The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers tokenizer. tokenizer_mode: The tokenizer mode. \"auto\" will use the fast tokenizer if available, and \"slow\" will always use the slow tokenizer. skip_tokenizer_init: If true, skip initialization of tokenizer and detokenizer. Expect valid prompt_token_ids and None for prompt from the input. trust_remote_code: Trust remote code (e.g., from HuggingFace) when downloading the model and tokenizer. allowed_local_media_path: Allowing API requests to read local images or videos from directories specified by the server file system. This is a security risk. Should only be enabled in trusted environments. allowed_media_domains: If set, only media URLs that belong to this domain can be used for multi-modal inputs. tensor_parallel_size: The number of GPUs to use for distributed execution with tensor parallelism. dtype: The data type for the model weights and activations. Currently, we support `float32`, `float16`, and `bfloat16`. If `auto`, we use the `dtype` attribute of the Transformers model's config. However, if the `dtype` in the config is `float32`, we will use `float16` instead. quantization: The method used to quantize the model weights. Currently, we support \"awq\", \"gptq\", and \"fp8\" (experimental). If None, we first check the `quantization_config` attribute in the model config file. If that is None, we assume the model weights are not quantized and use `dtype` to determine the data type of the weights. revision: The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. tokenizer_revision: The specific tokenizer version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. seed: The seed to initialize the random number generator for sampling. gpu_memory_utilization: The ratio (between 0 and 1) of GPU memory to reserve for the model weights, activations, and KV cache. Higher values will increase the KV cache size and thus improve the model's throughput. However, if the value is too high, it may cause out-of- memory (OOM) errors. kv_cache_memory_bytes: Size of KV Cache per GPU in bytes. By default, this is set to None and vllm can automatically infer the kv cache size based on gpu_memory_utilization. However, users may want to manually specify the kv cache memory size. kv_cache_memory_bytes allows more fine-grain control of how much memory gets used when compared with using gpu_memory_utilization. Note that kv_cache_memory_bytes (when not-None) ignores gpu_memory_utilization swap_space: The size (GiB) of CPU memory per GPU to use as swap space. This can be used for temporarily storing the states of the requests when their `best_of` sampling parameters are larger than 1. If all requests will have `best_of=1`, you can safely set this to 0. Noting that `best_of` is only supported in V0. Otherwise, too small values may cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors. cpu_offload_gb: The size (GiB) of CPU memory to use for offloading the model weights. This virtually increases the GPU memory space you can use to hold the model weights, at the cost of CPU-GPU data transfer for every forward pass. enforce_eager: Whether to enforce eager execution. If True, we will disable CUDA graph and always execute the model in eager mode. If False, we will use CUDA graph and eager execution in hybrid. disable_custom_all_reduce: See [ParallelConfig][vllm.config.ParallelConfig]. hf_token: The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files . If `True`, will use the token generated when running `huggingface-cli login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`). hf_overrides: If a dictionary, contains arguments to be forwarded to the HuggingFace config. If a callable, it is called to update the HuggingFace config. mm_processor_kwargs: Arguments to be forwarded to the model's processor for multi-modal data, e.g., image processor. Overrides for the multi-modal processor obtained from `AutoProcessor.from_pretrained`. The available overrides depend on the model that is being run. For example, for Phi-3-Vision: `{\"num_crops\": 4}`. pooler_config: Initialize non-default pooling config for the pooling model. e.g. `PoolerConfig(pooling_type=\"mean\", normalize=False)`. compilation_config: Either an integer or a dictionary. If it is an integer, it is used as the mode of compilation optimization. If it is a dictionary, it can specify the full compilation configuration. attention_config: Configuration for attention mechanisms. Can be a dictionary or an AttentionConfig instance. If a dictionary, it will be converted to an AttentionConfig. Allows specifying the attention backend and other attention-related settings. **kwargs: Arguments for [`EngineArgs`][vllm.EngineArgs]. Note: This class is intended to be used for offline inference. For online serving, use the [AsyncLLMEngine][vllm.AsyncLLMEngine] class instead. \"\"\" def __init__( self, model: str, *, runner: RunnerOption = \"auto\", convert: ConvertOption = \"auto\", tokenizer: str | None = None, tokenizer_mode: TokenizerMode | str = \"auto\", skip_tokenizer_init: bool = False, trust_remote_code: bool = False, allowed_local_media_path: str = \"\", allowed_media_domains: list[str] | None = None, tensor_parallel_size: int = 1, dtype: ModelDType = \"auto\", quantization: QuantizationMethods | None = None, revision: str | None = None, tokenizer_revision: str | None = None, seed: int = 0, gpu_memory_utilization: float = 0.9, swap_space: float = 4, cpu_offload_gb: float = 0, enforce_eager: bool = False, disable_custom_all_reduce: bool = False, hf_token: bool | str | None = None, hf_overrides: HfOverrides | None = None, mm_processor_kwargs: dict[str, Any] | None = None, pooler_config: PoolerConfig | None = None, structured_outputs_config: dict[str, Any] | StructuredOutputsConfig | None = None, profiler_config: dict[str, Any] | ProfilerConfig | None = None, attention_config: dict[str, Any] | AttentionConfig | None = None, kv_cache_memory_bytes: int | None = None, compilation_config: int | dict[str, Any] | CompilationConfig | None = None, logits_processors: list[str | type[LogitsProcessor]] | None = None, **kwargs: Any, ) -> None: \"\"\"LLM constructor.\"\"\" if \"disable_log_stats\" not in kwargs: kwargs[\"disable_log_stats\"] = True if \"worker_cls\" in kwargs: worker_cls = kwargs[\"worker_cls\"] # if the worker_cls is not qualified string name, # we serialize it using cloudpickle to avoid pickling issues if isinstance(worker_cls, type): kwargs[\"worker_cls\"] = cloudpickle.dumps(worker_cls) if \"kv_transfer_config\" in kwargs and isinstance( kwargs[\"kv_transfer_config\"], dict ): from vllm.config.kv_transfer import KVTransferConfig raw_config_dict = kwargs[\"kv_transfer_config\"] try: kwargs[\"kv_transfer_config\"] = KVTransferConfig(**raw_config_dict) except ValidationError as e: logger.error( \"Failed to convert 'kv_transfer_config' dict to \" \"KVTransferConfig object.

If a callable (e.g., `functools.partial(tqdm, leave=False)`), it is used to create the progress bar. If `False`, no progress bar is created. lora_request: LoRA request to use for generation, if any. priority: The priority of the requests, if any. Only applicable when priority scheduling policy is enabled. If provided, must be a list of integers matching the length of `prompts`, where each priority value corresponds to the prompt at the same index.

      "description": "vllm.entrypoints.llm ¶ _R module-attribute ¶ _R = TypeVar('_R', default=Any) logger module-attribute ¶ logger = init_logger(__name__) LLM ¶ An LLM for generating texts from given prompts and sampling parameters. This class includes a tokenizer, a language model (possibly distributed across multiple GPUs), and GPU memory space allocated for intermediate states (aka KV cache). Given a batch of prompts and sampling parameters, this class generates texts from the model, using an intelligent batching mechanism and efficient memory management. Parameters: Name Type Description Default model str The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers model. required tokenizer str | None The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers tokenizer. None tokenizer_mode TokenizerMode | str The tokenizer mode. \"auto\" will use the fast tokenizer if available, and \"slow\" will always use the slow tokenizer. 'auto' skip_tokenizer_init bool If true, skip initialization of tokenizer and detokenizer. Expect valid prompt_token_ids and None for prompt from the input. False trust_remote_code bool Trust remote code (e.g., from HuggingFace) when downloading the model and tokenizer. False allowed_local_media_path str Allowing API requests to read local images or videos from directories specified by the server file system. This is a security risk. Should only be enabled in trusted environments. '' allowed_media_domains list[str] | None If set, only media URLs that belong to this domain can be used for multi-modal inputs. None tensor_parallel_size int The number of GPUs to use for distributed execution with tensor parallelism. 1 dtype ModelDType The data type for the model weights and activations. Currently, we support float32, float16, and bfloat16. If auto, we use the dtype attribute of the Transformers model's config. However, if the dtype in the config is float32, we will use float16 instead. 'auto' quantization QuantizationMethods | None The method used to quantize the model weights. Currently, we support \"awq\", \"gptq\", and \"fp8\" (experimental). If None, we first check the quantization_config attribute in the model config file. If that is None, we assume the model weights are not quantized and use dtype to determine the data type of the weights. None revision str | None The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. None tokenizer_revision str | None The specific tokenizer version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. None seed int The seed to initialize the random number generator for sampling. 0 gpu_memory_utilization float The ratio (between 0 and 1) of GPU memory to reserve for the model weights, activations, and KV cache. Higher values will increase the KV cache size and thus improve the model's throughput. However, if the value is too high, it may cause out-of- memory (OOM) errors. 0.9 kv_cache_memory_bytes int | None Size of KV Cache per GPU in bytes. By default, this is set to None and vllm can automatically infer the kv cache size based on gpu_memory_utilization. However, users may want to manually specify the kv cache memory size. kv_cache_memory_bytes allows more fine-grain control of how much memory gets used when compared with using gpu_memory_utilization. Note that kv_cache_memory_bytes (when not-None) ignores gpu_memory_utilization None swap_space float The size (GiB) of CPU memory per GPU to use as swap space. This can be used for temporarily storing the states of the requests when their best_of sampling parameters are larger than 1. If all requests will have best_of=1, you can safely set this to 0. Noting that best_of is only supported in V0. Otherwise, too small values may cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors. 4 cpu_offload_gb float The size (GiB) of CPU memory to use for offloading the model weights. This virtually increases the GPU memory space you can use to hold the model weights, at the cost of CPU-GPU data transfer for every forward pass. 0 enforce_eager bool Whether to enforce eager execution. If True, we will disable CUDA graph and always execute the model in eager mode. If False, we will use CUDA graph and eager execution in hybrid. False disable_custom_all_reduce bool See ParallelConfig. False hf_token bool | str | None The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files . If True, will use the token generated when running huggingface-cli login (stored in ~/.huggingface). None hf_overrides HfOverrides | None If a dictionary, contains arguments to be forwarded to the HuggingFace config. If a callable, it is called to update the HuggingFace config. None mm_processor_kwargs dict[str, Any] | None Arguments to be forwarded to the model's processor for multi-modal data, e.g., image processor. Overrides for the multi-modal processor obtained from AutoProcessor.from_pretrained. The available overrides depend on the model that is being run. For example, for Phi-3-Vision: {\"num_crops\": 4}. None pooler_config PoolerConfig | None Initialize non-default pooling config for the pooling model. e.g. PoolerConfig(pooling_type=\"mean\", normalize=False). None compilation_config int | dict[str, Any] | CompilationConfig | None Either an integer or a dictionary. If it is an integer, it is used as the mode of compilation optimization. If it is a dictionary, it can specify the full compilation configuration. None attention_config dict[str, Any] | AttentionConfig | None Configuration for attention mechanisms. Can be a dictionary or an AttentionConfig instance. If a dictionary, it will be converted to an AttentionConfig. Allows specifying the attention backend and other attention-related settings. None **kwargs Any Arguments for EngineArgs. {} Note This class is intended to be used for offline inference. For online serving, use the AsyncLLMEngine class instead.

1788class LLM: \"\"\"An LLM for generating texts from given prompts and sampling parameters. This class includes a tokenizer, a language model (possibly distributed across multiple GPUs), and GPU memory space allocated for intermediate states (aka KV cache). Given a batch of prompts and sampling parameters, this class generates texts from the model, using an intelligent batching mechanism and efficient memory management. Args: model: The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers model. tokenizer: The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers tokenizer. tokenizer_mode: The tokenizer mode. \"auto\" will use the fast tokenizer if available, and \"slow\" will always use the slow tokenizer. skip_tokenizer_init: If true, skip initialization of tokenizer and detokenizer. Expect valid prompt_token_ids and None for prompt from the input. trust_remote_code: Trust remote code (e.g., from HuggingFace) when downloading the model and tokenizer. allowed_local_media_path: Allowing API requests to read local images or videos from directories specified by the server file system. This is a security risk. Should only be enabled in trusted environments. allowed_media_domains: If set, only media URLs that belong to this domain can be used for multi-modal inputs. tensor_parallel_size: The number of GPUs to use for distributed execution with tensor parallelism. dtype: The data type for the model weights and activations. Currently, we support `float32`, `float16`, and `bfloat16`. If `auto`, we use the `dtype` attribute of the Transformers model's config. However, if the `dtype` in the config is `float32`, we will use `float16` instead. quantization: The method used to quantize the model weights. Currently, we support \"awq\", \"gptq\", and \"fp8\" (experimental). If None, we first check the `quantization_config` attribute in the model config file. If that is None, we assume the model weights are not quantized and use `dtype` to determine the data type of the weights. revision: The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. tokenizer_revision: The specific tokenizer version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. seed: The seed to initialize the random number generator for sampling. gpu_memory_utilization: The ratio (between 0 and 1) of GPU memory to reserve for the model weights, activations, and KV cache. Higher values will increase the KV cache size and thus improve the model's throughput. However, if the value is too high, it may cause out-of- memory (OOM) errors. kv_cache_memory_bytes: Size of KV Cache per GPU in bytes. By default, this is set to None and vllm can automatically infer the kv cache size based on gpu_memory_utilization. However, users may want to manually specify the kv cache memory size. kv_cache_memory_bytes allows more fine-grain control of how much memory gets used when compared with using gpu_memory_utilization. Note that kv_cache_memory_bytes (when not-None) ignores gpu_memory_utilization swap_space: The size (GiB) of CPU memory per GPU to use as swap space. This can be used for temporarily storing the states of the requests when their `best_of` sampling parameters are larger than 1. If all requests will have `best_of=1`, you can safely set this to 0. Noting that `best_of` is only supported in V0. Otherwise, too small values may cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors. cpu_offload_gb: The size (GiB) of CPU memory to use for offloading the model weights. This virtually increases the GPU memory space you can use to hold the model weights, at the cost of CPU-GPU data transfer for every forward pass. enforce_eager: Whether to enforce eager execution. If True, we will disable CUDA graph and always execute the model in eager mode. If False, we will use CUDA graph and eager execution in hybrid. disable_custom_all_reduce: See [ParallelConfig][vllm.config.ParallelConfig]. hf_token: The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files . If `True`, will use the token generated when running `huggingface-cli login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`). hf_overrides: If a dictionary, contains arguments to be forwarded to the HuggingFace config. If a callable, it is called to update the HuggingFace config. mm_processor_kwargs: Arguments to be forwarded to the model's processor for multi-modal data, e.g., image processor. Overrides for the multi-modal processor obtained from `AutoProcessor.from_pretrained`. The available overrides depend on the model that is being run. For example, for Phi-3-Vision: `{\"num_crops\": 4}`. pooler_config: Initialize non-default pooling config for the pooling model. e.g. `PoolerConfig(pooling_type=\"mean\", normalize=False)`. compilation_config: Either an integer or a dictionary. If it is an integer, it is used as the mode of compilation optimization. If it is a dictionary, it can specify the full compilation configuration. attention_config: Configuration for attention mechanisms. Can be a dictionary or an AttentionConfig instance. If a dictionary, it will be converted to an AttentionConfig. Allows specifying the attention backend and other attention-related settings. **kwargs: Arguments for [`EngineArgs`][vllm.EngineArgs]. Note: This class is intended to be used for offline inference. For online serving, use the [AsyncLLMEngine][vllm.AsyncLLMEngine] class instead. \"\"\" def __init__( self, model: str, *, runner: RunnerOption = \"auto\", convert: ConvertOption = \"auto\", tokenizer: str | None = None, tokenizer_mode: TokenizerMode | str = \"auto\", skip_tokenizer_init: bool = False, trust_remote_code: bool = False, allowed_local_media_path: str = \"\", allowed_media_domains: list[str] | None = None, tensor_parallel_size: int = 1, dtype: ModelDType = \"auto\", quantization: QuantizationMethods | None = None, revision: str | None = None, tokenizer_revision: str | None = None, seed: int = 0, gpu_memory_utilization: float = 0.9, swap_space: float = 4, cpu_offload_gb: float = 0, enforce_eager: bool = False, disable_custom_all_reduce: bool = False, hf_token: bool | str | None = None, hf_overrides: HfOverrides | None = None, mm_processor_kwargs: dict[str, Any] | None = None, pooler_config: PoolerConfig | None = None, structured_outputs_config: dict[str, Any] | StructuredOutputsConfig | None = None, profiler_config: dict[str, Any] | ProfilerConfig | None = None, attention_config: dict[str, Any] | AttentionConfig | None = None, kv_cache_memory_bytes: int | None = None, compilation_config: int | dict[str, Any] | CompilationConfig | None = None, logits_processors: list[str | type[LogitsProcessor]] | None = None, **kwargs: Any, ) -> None: \"\"\"LLM constructor.\"\"\" if \"disable_log_stats\" not in kwargs: kwargs[\"disable_log_stats\"] = True if \"worker_cls\" in kwargs: worker_cls = kwargs[\"worker_cls\"] # if the worker_cls is not qualified string name, # we serialize it using cloudpickle to avoid pickling issues if isinstance(worker_cls, type): kwargs[\"worker_cls\"] = cloudpickle.dumps(worker_cls) if \"kv_transfer_config\" in kwargs and isinstance( kwargs[\"kv_transfer_config\"], dict ): from vllm.config.kv_transfer import KVTransferConfig raw_config_dict = kwargs[\"kv_transfer_config\"] try: kwargs[\"kv_transfer_config\"] = KVTransferConfig(**raw_config_dict) except ValidationError as e: logger.error( \"Failed to convert 'kv_transfer_config' dict to \" \"KVTransferConfig object.

      "description": "_R module-attribute ¶ _R = TypeVar('_R', default=Any) logger module-attribute ¶ logger = init_logger(__name__) LLM ¶ An LLM for generating texts from given prompts and sampling parameters. This class includes a tokenizer, a language model (possibly distributed across multiple GPUs), and GPU memory space allocated for intermediate states (aka KV cache). Given a batch of prompts and sampling parameters, this class generates texts from the model, using an intelligent batching mechanism and efficient memory management. Parameters: Name Type Description Default model str The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers model. required tokenizer str | None The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers tokenizer. None tokenizer_mode TokenizerMode | str The tokenizer mode. \"auto\" will use the fast tokenizer if available, and \"slow\" will always use the slow tokenizer. 'auto' skip_tokenizer_init bool If true, skip initialization of tokenizer and detokenizer. Expect valid prompt_token_ids and None for prompt from the input. False trust_remote_code bool Trust remote code (e.g., from HuggingFace) when downloading the model and tokenizer. False allowed_local_media_path str Allowing API requests to read local images or videos from directories specified by the server file system. This is a security risk. Should only be enabled in trusted environments. '' allowed_media_domains list[str] | None If set, only media URLs that belong to this domain can be used for multi-modal inputs. None tensor_parallel_size int The number of GPUs to use for distributed execution with tensor parallelism. 1 dtype ModelDType The data type for the model weights and activations. Currently, we support float32, float16, and bfloat16. If auto, we use the dtype attribute of the Transformers model's config. However, if the dtype in the config is float32, we will use float16 instead. 'auto' quantization QuantizationMethods | None The method used to quantize the model weights. Currently, we support \"awq\", \"gptq\", and \"fp8\" (experimental). If None, we first check the quantization_config attribute in the model config file. If that is None, we assume the model weights are not quantized and use dtype to determine the data type of the weights. None revision str | None The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. None tokenizer_revision str | None The specific tokenizer version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. None seed int The seed to initialize the random number generator for sampling. 0 gpu_memory_utilization float The ratio (between 0 and 1) of GPU memory to reserve for the model weights, activations, and KV cache. Higher values will increase the KV cache size and thus improve the model's throughput. However, if the value is too high, it may cause out-of- memory (OOM) errors. 0.9 kv_cache_memory_bytes int | None Size of KV Cache per GPU in bytes. By default, this is set to None and vllm can automatically infer the kv cache size based on gpu_memory_utilization. However, users may want to manually specify the kv cache memory size. kv_cache_memory_bytes allows more fine-grain control of how much memory gets used when compared with using gpu_memory_utilization. Note that kv_cache_memory_bytes (when not-None) ignores gpu_memory_utilization None swap_space float The size (GiB) of CPU memory per GPU to use as swap space. This can be used for temporarily storing the states of the requests when their best_of sampling parameters are larger than 1. If all requests will have best_of=1, you can safely set this to 0. Noting that best_of is only supported in V0. Otherwise, too small values may cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors. 4 cpu_offload_gb float The size (GiB) of CPU memory to use for offloading the model weights. This virtually increases the GPU memory space you can use to hold the model weights, at the cost of CPU-GPU data transfer for every forward pass. 0 enforce_eager bool Whether to enforce eager execution. If True, we will disable CUDA graph and always execute the model in eager mode. If False, we will use CUDA graph and eager execution in hybrid. False disable_custom_all_reduce bool See ParallelConfig. False hf_token bool | str | None The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files . If True, will use the token generated when running huggingface-cli login (stored in ~/.huggingface). None hf_overrides HfOverrides | None If a dictionary, contains arguments to be forwarded to the HuggingFace config. If a callable, it is called to update the HuggingFace config. None mm_processor_kwargs dict[str, Any] | None Arguments to be forwarded to the model's processor for multi-modal data, e.g., image processor. Overrides for the multi-modal processor obtained from AutoProcessor.from_pretrained. The available overrides depend on the model that is being run. For example, for Phi-3-Vision: {\"num_crops\": 4}. None pooler_config PoolerConfig | None Initialize non-default pooling config for the pooling model. e.g. PoolerConfig(pooling_type=\"mean\", normalize=False). None compilation_config int | dict[str, Any] | CompilationConfig | None Either an integer or a dictionary. If it is an integer, it is used as the mode of compilation optimization. If it is a dictionary, it can specify the full compilation configuration. None attention_config dict[str, Any] | AttentionConfig | None Configuration for attention mechanisms. Can be a dictionary or an AttentionConfig instance. If a dictionary, it will be converted to an AttentionConfig. Allows specifying the attention backend and other attention-related settings.

1788class LLM: \"\"\"An LLM for generating texts from given prompts and sampling parameters. This class includes a tokenizer, a language model (possibly distributed across multiple GPUs), and GPU memory space allocated for intermediate states (aka KV cache). Given a batch of prompts and sampling parameters, this class generates texts from the model, using an intelligent batching mechanism and efficient memory management. Args: model: The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers model. tokenizer: The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers tokenizer. tokenizer_mode: The tokenizer mode. \"auto\" will use the fast tokenizer if available, and \"slow\" will always use the slow tokenizer. skip_tokenizer_init: If true, skip initialization of tokenizer and detokenizer. Expect valid prompt_token_ids and None for prompt from the input. trust_remote_code: Trust remote code (e.g., from HuggingFace) when downloading the model and tokenizer. allowed_local_media_path: Allowing API requests to read local images or videos from directories specified by the server file system. This is a security risk. Should only be enabled in trusted environments. allowed_media_domains: If set, only media URLs that belong to this domain can be used for multi-modal inputs. tensor_parallel_size: The number of GPUs to use for distributed execution with tensor parallelism. dtype: The data type for the model weights and activations. Currently, we support `float32`, `float16`, and `bfloat16`. If `auto`, we use the `dtype` attribute of the Transformers model's config. However, if the `dtype` in the config is `float32`, we will use `float16` instead. quantization: The method used to quantize the model weights. Currently, we support \"awq\", \"gptq\", and \"fp8\" (experimental). If None, we first check the `quantization_config` attribute in the model config file. If that is None, we assume the model weights are not quantized and use `dtype` to determine the data type of the weights. revision: The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. tokenizer_revision: The specific tokenizer version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. seed: The seed to initialize the random number generator for sampling. gpu_memory_utilization: The ratio (between 0 and 1) of GPU memory to reserve for the model weights, activations, and KV cache. Higher values will increase the KV cache size and thus improve the model's throughput. However, if the value is too high, it may cause out-of- memory (OOM) errors. kv_cache_memory_bytes: Size of KV Cache per GPU in bytes. By default, this is set to None and vllm can automatically infer the kv cache size based on gpu_memory_utilization. However, users may want to manually specify the kv cache memory size. kv_cache_memory_bytes allows more fine-grain control of how much memory gets used when compared with using gpu_memory_utilization. Note that kv_cache_memory_bytes (when not-None) ignores gpu_memory_utilization swap_space: The size (GiB) of CPU memory per GPU to use as swap space. This can be used for temporarily storing the states of the requests when their `best_of` sampling parameters are larger than 1. If all requests will have `best_of=1`, you can safely set this to 0. Noting that `best_of` is only supported in V0. Otherwise, too small values may cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors. cpu_offload_gb: The size (GiB) of CPU memory to use for offloading the model weights. This virtually increases the GPU memory space you can use to hold the model weights, at the cost of CPU-GPU data transfer for every forward pass. enforce_eager: Whether to enforce eager execution. If True, we will disable CUDA graph and always execute the model in eager mode. If False, we will use CUDA graph and eager execution in hybrid. disable_custom_all_reduce: See [ParallelConfig][vllm.config.ParallelConfig]. hf_token: The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files . If `True`, will use the token generated when running `huggingface-cli login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`). hf_overrides: If a dictionary, contains arguments to be forwarded to the HuggingFace config. If a callable, it is called to update the HuggingFace config. mm_processor_kwargs: Arguments to be forwarded to the model's processor for multi-modal data, e.g., image processor. Overrides for the multi-modal processor obtained from `AutoProcessor.from_pretrained`. The available overrides depend on the model that is being run. For example, for Phi-3-Vision: `{\"num_crops\": 4}`. pooler_config: Initialize non-default pooling config for the pooling model. e.g. `PoolerConfig(pooling_type=\"mean\", normalize=False)`. compilation_config: Either an integer or a dictionary. If it is an integer, it is used as the mode of compilation optimization. If it is a dictionary, it can specify the full compilation configuration. attention_config: Configuration for attention mechanisms. Can be a dictionary or an AttentionConfig instance. If a dictionary, it will be converted to an AttentionConfig. Allows specifying the attention backend and other attention-related settings. **kwargs: Arguments for [`EngineArgs`][vllm.EngineArgs]. Note: This class is intended to be used for offline inference. For online serving, use the [AsyncLLMEngine][vllm.AsyncLLMEngine] class instead. \"\"\" def __init__( self, model: str, *, runner: RunnerOption = \"auto\", convert: ConvertOption = \"auto\", tokenizer: str | None = None, tokenizer_mode: TokenizerMode | str = \"auto\", skip_tokenizer_init: bool = False, trust_remote_code: bool = False, allowed_local_media_path: str = \"\", allowed_media_domains: list[str] | None = None, tensor_parallel_size: int = 1, dtype: ModelDType = \"auto\", quantization: QuantizationMethods | None = None, revision: str | None = None, tokenizer_revision: str | None = None, seed: int = 0, gpu_memory_utilization: float = 0.9, swap_space: float = 4, cpu_offload_gb: float = 0, enforce_eager: bool = False, disable_custom_all_reduce: bool = False, hf_token: bool | str | None = None, hf_overrides: HfOverrides | None = None, mm_processor_kwargs: dict[str, Any] | None = None, pooler_config: PoolerConfig | None = None, structured_outputs_config: dict[str, Any] | StructuredOutputsConfig | None = None, profiler_config: dict[str, Any] | ProfilerConfig | None = None, attention_config: dict[str, Any] | AttentionConfig | None = None, kv_cache_memory_bytes: int | None = None, compilation_config: int | dict[str, Any] | CompilationConfig | None = None, logits_processors: list[str | type[LogitsProcessor]] | None = None, **kwargs: Any, ) -> None: \"\"\"LLM constructor.\"\"\" if \"disable_log_stats\" not in kwargs: kwargs[\"disable_log_stats\"] = True if \"worker_cls\" in kwargs: worker_cls = kwargs[\"worker_cls\"] # if the worker_cls is not qualified string name, # we serialize it using cloudpickle to avoid pickling issues if isinstance(worker_cls, type): kwargs[\"worker_cls\"] = cloudpickle.dumps(worker_cls) if \"kv_transfer_config\" in kwargs and isinstance( kwargs[\"kv_transfer_config\"], dict ): from vllm.config.kv_transfer import KVTransferConfig raw_config_dict = kwargs[\"kv_transfer_config\"] try: kwargs[\"kv_transfer_config\"] = KVTransferConfig(**raw_config_dict) except ValidationError as e: logger.error( \"Failed to convert 'kv_transfer_config' dict to \" \"KVTransferConfig object.

      "description": "_R module-attribute ¶ _R = TypeVar('_R', default=Any) logger module-attribute ¶ logger = init_logger(__name__) LLM ¶ An LLM for generating texts from given prompts and sampling parameters. This class includes a tokenizer, a language model (possibly distributed across multiple GPUs), and GPU memory space allocated for intermediate states (aka KV cache). Given a batch of prompts and sampling parameters, this class generates texts from the model, using an intelligent batching mechanism and efficient memory management. Parameters: Name Type Description Default model str The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers model. required tokenizer str | None The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers tokenizer. None tokenizer_mode TokenizerMode | str The tokenizer mode. \"auto\" will use the fast tokenizer if available, and \"slow\" will always use the slow tokenizer. 'auto' skip_tokenizer_init bool If true, skip initialization of tokenizer and detokenizer. Expect valid prompt_token_ids and None for prompt from the input. False trust_remote_code bool Trust remote code (e.g., from HuggingFace) when downloading the model and tokenizer. False allowed_local_media_path str Allowing API requests to read local images or videos from directories specified by the server file system. This is a security risk. Should only be enabled in trusted environments. '' allowed_media_domains list[str] | None If set, only media URLs that belong to this domain can be used for multi-modal inputs. None tensor_parallel_size int The number of GPUs to use for distributed execution with tensor parallelism. 1 dtype ModelDType The data type for the model weights and activations. Currently, we support float32, float16, and bfloat16. If auto, we use the dtype attribute of the Transformers model's config. However, if the dtype in the config is float32, we will use float16 instead. 'auto' quantization QuantizationMethods | None The method used to quantize the model weights. Currently, we support \"awq\", \"gptq\", and \"fp8\" (experimental). If None, we first check the quantization_config attribute in the model config file. If that is None, we assume the model weights are not quantized and use dtype to determine the data type of the weights. None revision str | None The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. None tokenizer_revision str | None The specific tokenizer version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. None seed int The seed to initialize the random number generator for sampling. 0 gpu_memory_utilization float The ratio (between 0 and 1) of GPU memory to reserve for the model weights, activations, and KV cache. Higher values will increase the KV cache size and thus improve the model's throughput. However, if the value is too high, it may cause out-of- memory (OOM) errors. 0.9 kv_cache_memory_bytes int | None Size of KV Cache per GPU in bytes. By default, this is set to None and vllm can automatically infer the kv cache size based on gpu_memory_utilization. However, users may want to manually specify the kv cache memory size. kv_cache_memory_bytes allows more fine-grain control of how much memory gets used when compared with using gpu_memory_utilization. Note that kv_cache_memory_bytes (when not-None) ignores gpu_memory_utilization None swap_space float The size (GiB) of CPU memory per GPU to use as swap space. This can be used for temporarily storing the states of the requests when their best_of sampling parameters are larger than 1. If all requests will have best_of=1, you can safely set this to 0. Noting that best_of is only supported in V0. Otherwise, too small values may cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors. 4 cpu_offload_gb float The size (GiB) of CPU memory to use for offloading the model weights. This virtually increases the GPU memory space you can use to hold the model weights, at the cost of CPU-GPU data transfer for every forward pass. 0 enforce_eager bool Whether to enforce eager execution. If True, we will disable CUDA graph and always execute the model in eager mode. If False, we will use CUDA graph and eager execution in hybrid. False disable_custom_all_reduce bool See ParallelConfig. False hf_token bool | str | None The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files . If True, will use the token generated when running huggingface-cli login (stored in ~/.huggingface). None hf_overrides HfOverrides | None If a dictionary, contains arguments to be forwarded to the HuggingFace config. If a callable, it is called to update the HuggingFace config. None mm_processor_kwargs dict[str, Any] | None Arguments to be forwarded to the model's processor for multi-modal data, e.g., image processor. Overrides for the multi-modal processor obtained from AutoProcessor.from_pretrained. The available overrides depend on the model that is being run. For example, for Phi-3-Vision: {\"num_crops\": 4}. None pooler_config PoolerConfig | None Initialize non-default pooling config for the pooling model. e.g. PoolerConfig(pooling_type=\"mean\", normalize=False). None compilation_config int | dict[str, Any] | CompilationConfig | None Either an integer or a dictionary. If it is an integer, it is used as the mode of compilation optimization. If it is a dictionary, it can specify the full compilation configuration. None attention_config dict[str, Any] | AttentionConfig | None Configuration for attention mechanisms. Can be a dictionary or an AttentionConfig instance. If a dictionary, it will be converted to an AttentionConfig. Allows specifying the attention backend and other attention-related settings. None **kwargs Any Arguments for EngineArgs. {} Note This class is intended to be used for offline inference. For online serving, use the AsyncLLMEngine class instead.

1788class LLM: \"\"\"An LLM for generating texts from given prompts and sampling parameters. This class includes a tokenizer, a language model (possibly distributed across multiple GPUs), and GPU memory space allocated for intermediate states (aka KV cache). Given a batch of prompts and sampling parameters, this class generates texts from the model, using an intelligent batching mechanism and efficient memory management. Args: model: The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers model. tokenizer: The name or path of a HuggingFace Transformers tokenizer. tokenizer_mode: The tokenizer mode. \"auto\" will use the fast tokenizer if available, and \"slow\" will always use the slow tokenizer. skip_tokenizer_init: If true, skip initialization of tokenizer and detokenizer. Expect valid prompt_token_ids and None for prompt from the input. trust_remote_code: Trust remote code (e.g., from HuggingFace) when downloading the model and tokenizer. allowed_local_media_path: Allowing API requests to read local images or videos from directories specified by the server file system. This is a security risk. Should only be enabled in trusted environments. allowed_media_domains: If set, only media URLs that belong to this domain can be used for multi-modal inputs. tensor_parallel_size: The number of GPUs to use for distributed execution with tensor parallelism. dtype: The data type for the model weights and activations. Currently, we support `float32`, `float16`, and `bfloat16`. If `auto`, we use the `dtype` attribute of the Transformers model's config. However, if the `dtype` in the config is `float32`, we will use `float16` instead. quantization: The method used to quantize the model weights. Currently, we support \"awq\", \"gptq\", and \"fp8\" (experimental). If None, we first check the `quantization_config` attribute in the model config file. If that is None, we assume the model weights are not quantized and use `dtype` to determine the data type of the weights. revision: The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. tokenizer_revision: The specific tokenizer version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id. seed: The seed to initialize the random number generator for sampling. gpu_memory_utilization: The ratio (between 0 and 1) of GPU memory to reserve for the model weights, activations, and KV cache. Higher values will increase the KV cache size and thus improve the model's throughput. However, if the value is too high, it may cause out-of- memory (OOM) errors. kv_cache_memory_bytes: Size of KV Cache per GPU in bytes. By default, this is set to None and vllm can automatically infer the kv cache size based on gpu_memory_utilization. However, users may want to manually specify the kv cache memory size. kv_cache_memory_bytes allows more fine-grain control of how much memory gets used when compared with using gpu_memory_utilization. Note that kv_cache_memory_bytes (when not-None) ignores gpu_memory_utilization swap_space: The size (GiB) of CPU memory per GPU to use as swap space. This can be used for temporarily storing the states of the requests when their `best_of` sampling parameters are larger than 1. If all requests will have `best_of=1`, you can safely set this to 0. Noting that `best_of` is only supported in V0. Otherwise, too small values may cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors. cpu_offload_gb: The size (GiB) of CPU memory to use for offloading the model weights. This virtually increases the GPU memory space you can use to hold the model weights, at the cost of CPU-GPU data transfer for every forward pass. enforce_eager: Whether to enforce eager execution. If True, we will disable CUDA graph and always execute the model in eager mode. If False, we will use CUDA graph and eager execution in hybrid. disable_custom_all_reduce: See [ParallelConfig][vllm.config.ParallelConfig]. hf_token: The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files . If `True`, will use the token generated when running `huggingface-cli login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`). hf_overrides: If a dictionary, contains arguments to be forwarded to the HuggingFace config. If a callable, it is called to update the HuggingFace config. mm_processor_kwargs: Arguments to be forwarded to the model's processor for multi-modal data, e.g., image processor. Overrides for the multi-modal processor obtained from `AutoProcessor.from_pretrained`. The available overrides depend on the model that is being run. For example, for Phi-3-Vision: `{\"num_crops\": 4}`. pooler_config: Initialize non-default pooling config for the pooling model. e.g. `PoolerConfig(pooling_type=\"mean\", normalize=False)`. compilation_config: Either an integer or a dictionary. If it is an integer, it is used as the mode of compilation optimization. If it is a dictionary, it can specify the full compilation configuration. attention_config: Configuration for attention mechanisms. Can be a dictionary or an AttentionConfig instance. If a dictionary, it will be converted to an AttentionConfig. Allows specifying the attention backend and other attention-related settings. **kwargs: Arguments for [`EngineArgs`][vllm.EngineArgs]. Note: This class is intended to be used for offline inference. For online serving, use the [AsyncLLMEngine][vllm.AsyncLLMEngine] class instead. \"\"\" def __init__( self, model: str, *, runner: RunnerOption = \"auto\", convert: ConvertOption = \"auto\", tokenizer: str | None = None, tokenizer_mode: TokenizerMode | str = \"auto\", skip_tokenizer_init: bool = False, trust_remote_code: bool = False, allowed_local_media_path: str = \"\", allowed_media_domains: list[str] | None = None, tensor_parallel_size: int = 1, dtype: ModelDType = \"auto\", quantization: QuantizationMethods | None = None, revision: str | None = None, tokenizer_revision: str | None = None, seed: int = 0, gpu_memory_utilization: float = 0.9, swap_space: float = 4, cpu_offload_gb: float = 0, enforce_eager: bool = False, disable_custom_all_reduce: bool = False, hf_token: bool | str | None = None, hf_overrides: HfOverrides | None = None, mm_processor_kwargs: dict[str, Any] | None = None, pooler_config: PoolerConfig | None = None, structured_outputs_config: dict[str, Any] | StructuredOutputsConfig | None = None, profiler_config: dict[str, Any] | ProfilerConfig | None = None, attention_config: dict[str, Any] | AttentionConfig | None = None, kv_cache_memory_bytes: int | None = None, compilation_config: int | dict[str, Any] | CompilationConfig | None = None, logits_processors: list[str | type[LogitsProcessor]] | None = None, **kwargs: Any, ) -> None: \"\"\"LLM constructor.\"\"\" if \"disable_log_stats\" not in kwargs: kwargs[\"disable_log_stats\"] = True if \"worker_cls\" in kwargs: worker_cls = kwargs[\"worker_cls\"] # if the worker_cls is not qualified string name, # we serialize it using cloudpickle to avoid pickling issues if isinstance(worker_cls, type): kwargs[\"worker_cls\"] = cloudpickle.dumps(worker_cls) if \"kv_transfer_config\" in kwargs and isinstance( kwargs[\"kv_transfer_config\"], dict ): from vllm.config.kv_transfer import KVTransferConfig raw_config_dict = kwargs[\"kv_transfer_config\"] try: kwargs[\"kv_transfer_config\"] = KVTransferConfig(**raw_config_dict) except ValidationError as e: logger.error( \"Failed to convert 'kv_transfer_config' dict to \" \"KVTransferConfig object.

If a callable (e.g., `functools.partial(tqdm, leave=False)`), it is used to create the progress bar. If `False`, no progress bar is created. lora_request: LoRA request to use for generation, if any. priority: The priority of the requests, if any. Only applicable when priority scheduling policy is enabled. If provided, must be a list of integers matching the length of `prompts`, where each priority value corresponds to the prompt at the same index.
