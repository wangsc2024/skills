  "content": "The built-in browser <link> component lets you use external resources such as stylesheets or annotate the document with link metadata.\n\nTo link to external resources such as stylesheets, fonts, and icons, or to annotate the document with link metadata, render the built-in browser <link> component. You can render <link> from any component and React will in most cases place the corresponding DOM element in the document head.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\n<link> supports all common element props.\n\nThese props apply when rel=\"stylesheet\":\n\nThese props apply when rel=\"stylesheet\" but disable React’s special treatment of stylesheets:\n\nThese props apply when rel=\"preload\" or rel=\"modulepreload\":\n\nThese props apply when rel=\"icon\" or rel=\"apple-touch-icon\":\n\nThese props apply in all cases:\n\nProps that are not recommended for use with React:\n\nReact will always place the DOM element corresponding to the <link> component within the document’s <head>, regardless of where in the React tree it is rendered. The <head> is the only valid place for <link> to exist within the DOM, yet it’s convenient and keeps things composable if a component representing a specific page can render <link> components itself.\n\nThere are a few exceptions to this:\n\nIn addition, if the <link> is to a stylesheet (namely, it has rel=\"stylesheet\" in its props), React treats it specially in the following ways:\n\nThere are two exception to this special behavior:\n\nThis special treatment comes with two caveats:\n\nYou can annotate the document with links to related resources such as an icon, canonical URL, or pingback. React will place this metadata within the document <head> regardless of where in the React tree it is rendered.\n\nIf a component depends on a certain stylesheet in order to be displayed correctly, you can render a link to that stylesheet within the component. Your component will suspend while the stylesheet is loading. You must supply the precedence prop, which tells React where to place this stylesheet relative to others — stylesheets with higher precedence can override those with lower precedence.\n\nWhen you want to use a stylesheet, it can be beneficial to call the preinit function. Calling this function may allow the browser to start fetching the stylesheet earlier than if you just render a <link> component, for example by sending an HTTP Early Hints response.\n\nStylesheets can conflict with each other, and when they do, the browser goes with the one that comes later in the document. React lets you control the order of stylesheets with the precedence prop. In this example, three components render stylesheets, and the ones with the same precedence are grouped together in the <head>.\n\nNote the precedence values themselves are arbitrary and their naming is up to you. React will infer that precedence values it discovers first are “lower” and precedence values it discovers later are “higher”.\n\nIf you render the same stylesheet from multiple components, React will place only a single <link> in the document head.\n\nYou can use the <link> component with the itemProp prop to annotate specific items within the document with links to related resources. In this case, React will not place these annotations within the document <head> but will place them like any other React component.",
