  "content": "renderToStaticMarkup renders a non-interactive React tree to an HTML string.\n\nOn the server, call renderToStaticMarkup to render your app to HTML.\n\nIt will produce non-interactive HTML output of your React components.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nrenderToStaticMarkup output cannot be hydrated.\n\nrenderToStaticMarkup has limited Suspense support. If a component suspends, renderToStaticMarkup immediately sends its fallback as HTML.\n\nrenderToStaticMarkup works in the browser, but using it in the client code is not recommended. If you need to render a component to HTML in the browser, get the HTML by rendering it into a DOM node.\n\nCall renderToStaticMarkup to render your app to an HTML string which you can send with your server response:\n\nThis will produce the initial non-interactive HTML output of your React components.\n\nThis method renders non-interactive HTML that cannot be hydrated. This is useful if you want to use React as a simple static page generator, or if you’re rendering completely static content like emails.\n\nInteractive apps should use renderToString on the server and hydrateRoot on the client.",
