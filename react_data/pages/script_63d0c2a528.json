  "content": "The built-in browser <script> component lets you add a script to your document.\n\nTo add inline or external scripts to your document, render the built-in browser <script> component. You can render <script> from any component and React will in certain cases place the corresponding DOM element in the document head and de-duplicate identical scripts.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\n<script> supports all common element props.\n\nIt should have either children or a src prop.\n\nOther supported props:\n\nProps that disable React’s special treatment of scripts:\n\nProps that are not recommended for use with React:\n\nReact can move <script> components to the document’s <head> and de-duplicate identical scripts.\n\nTo opt into this behavior, provide the src and async={true} props. React will de-duplicate scripts if they have the same src. The async prop must be true to allow scripts to be safely moved.\n\nThis special treatment comes with two caveats:\n\nIf a component depends on certain scripts in order to be displayed correctly, you can render a <script> within the component. However, the component might be committed before the script has finished loading. You can start depending on the script content once the load event is fired e.g. by using the onLoad prop.\n\nReact will de-duplicate scripts that have the same src, inserting only one of them into the DOM even if multiple components render it.\n\nWhen you want to use a script, it can be beneficial to call the preinit function. Calling this function may allow the browser to start fetching the script earlier than if you just render a <script> component, for example by sending an HTTP Early Hints response.\n\nTo include an inline script, render the <script> component with the script source code as its children. Inline scripts are not de-duplicated or moved to the document <head>.",
