  "content": "useInsertionEffect is for CSS-in-JS library authors. Unless you are working on a CSS-in-JS library and need a place to inject the styles, you probably want useEffect or useLayoutEffect instead.\n\nuseInsertionEffect allows inserting elements into the DOM before any layout Effects fire.\n\nCall useInsertionEffect to insert styles before any Effects fire that may need to read layout:\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nsetup: The function with your Effect’s logic. Your setup function may also optionally return a cleanup function. When your component is added to the DOM, but before any layout Effects fire, React will run your setup function. After every re-render with changed dependencies, React will first run the cleanup function (if you provided it) with the old values, and then run your setup function with the new values. When your component is removed from the DOM, React will run your cleanup function.\n\noptional dependencies: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the setup code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3]. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the Object.is comparison algorithm. If you don’t specify the dependencies at all, your Effect will re-run after every re-render of the component.\n\nuseInsertionEffect returns undefined.\n\nTraditionally, you would style React components using plain CSS.\n\nSome teams prefer to author styles directly in JavaScript code instead of writing CSS files. This usually requires using a CSS-in-JS library or a tool. There are three common approaches to CSS-in-JS:\n\nIf you use CSS-in-JS, we recommend a combination of the first two approaches (CSS files for static styles, inline styles for dynamic styles). We don’t recommend runtime <style> tag injection for two reasons:\n\nThe first problem is not solvable, but useInsertionEffect helps you solve the second problem.\n\nCall useInsertionEffect to insert the styles before any layout Effects fire:\n\nSimilarly to useEffect, useInsertionEffect does not run on the server. If you need to collect which CSS rules have been used on the server, you can do it during rendering:\n\nRead more about upgrading CSS-in-JS libraries with runtime injection to useInsertionEffect.\n\nIf you insert styles during rendering and React is processing a non-blocking update, the browser will recalculate the styles every single frame while rendering a component tree, which can be extremely slow.\n\nuseInsertionEffect is better than inserting styles during useLayoutEffect or useEffect because it ensures that by the time other Effects run in your components, the <style> tags have already been inserted. Otherwise, layout calculations in regular Effects would be wrong due to outdated styles.",
