  "content": "memo lets you skip re-rendering a component when its props are unchanged.\n\nReact Compiler automatically applies the equivalent of memo to all components, reducing the need for manual memoization. You can use the compiler to handle component memoization automatically.\n\nWrap a component in memo to get a memoized version of that component. This memoized version of your component will usually not be re-rendered when its parent component is re-rendered as long as its props have not changed. But React may still re-render it: memoization is a performance optimization, not a guarantee.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nComponent: The component that you want to memoize. The memo does not modify this component, but returns a new, memoized component instead. Any valid React component, including functions and forwardRef components, is accepted.\n\noptional arePropsEqual: A function that accepts two arguments: the component’s previous props, and its new props. It should return true if the old and new props are equal: that is, if the component will render the same output and behave in the same way with the new props as with the old. Otherwise it should return false. Usually, you will not specify this function. By default, React will compare each prop with Object.is.\n\nmemo returns a new React component. It behaves the same as the component provided to memo except that React will not always re-render it when its parent is being re-rendered unless its props have changed.\n\nReact normally re-renders a component whenever its parent re-renders. With memo, you can create a component that React will not re-render when its parent re-renders so long as its new props are the same as the old props. Such a component is said to be memoized.\n\nTo memoize a component, wrap it in memo and use the value that it returns in place of your original component:\n\nA React component should always have pure rendering logic. This means that it must return the same output if its props, state, and context haven’t changed. By using memo, you are telling React that your component complies with this requirement, so React doesn’t need to re-render as long as its props haven’t changed. Even with memo, your component will re-render if its own state changes or if a context that it’s using changes.\n\nIn this example, notice that the Greeting component re-renders whenever name is changed (because that’s one of its props), but not when address is changed (because it’s not passed to Greeting as a prop):\n\nYou should only rely on memo as a performance optimization. If your code doesn’t work without it, find the underlying problem and fix it first. Then you may add memo to improve performance.\n\nIf your app is like this site, and most interactions are coarse (like replacing a page or an entire section), memoization is usually unnecessary. On the other hand, if your app is more like a drawing editor, and most interactions are granular (like moving shapes), then you might find memoization very helpful.\n\nOptimizing with memo is only valuable when your component re-renders often with the same exact props, and its re-rendering logic is expensive. If there is no perceptible lag when your component re-renders, memo is unnecessary. Keep in mind that memo is completely useless if the props passed to your component are always different, such as if you pass an object or a plain function defined during rendering. This is why you will often need useMemo and useCallback together with memo.\n\nThere is no benefit to wrapping a component in memo in other cases. There is no significant harm to doing that either, so some teams choose to not think about individual cases, and memoize as much as possible. The downside of this approach is that code becomes less readable. Also, not all memoization is effective: a single value that’s “always new” is enough to break memoization for an entire component.\n\nIn practice, you can make a lot of memoization unnecessary by following a few principles:\n\nIf a specific interaction still feels laggy, use the React Developer Tools profiler to see which components would benefit the most from memoization, and add memoization where needed. These principles make your components easier to debug and understand, so it’s good to follow them in any case. In the long term, we’re researching doing granular memoization automatically to solve this once and for all.\n\nEven when a component is memoized, it will still re-render when its own state changes. Memoization only has to do with props that are passed to the component from its parent.\n\nIf you set a state variable to its current value, React will skip re-rendering your component even without memo. You may still see your component function being called an extra time, but the result will be discarded.\n\nEven when a component is memoized, it will still re-render when a context that it’s using changes. Memoization only has to do with props that are passed to the component from its parent.\n\nTo make your component re-render only when a part of some context changes, split your component in two. Read what you need from the context in the outer component, and pass it down to a memoized child as a prop.\n\nWhen you use memo, your component re-renders whenever any prop is not shallowly equal to what it was previously. This means that React compares every prop in your component with its previous value using the Object.is comparison. Note that Object.is(3, 3) is true, but Object.is({}, {}) is false.\n\nTo get the most out of memo, minimize the times that the props change. For example, if the prop is an object, prevent the parent component from re-creating that object every time by using useMemo:\n\nA better way to minimize props changes is to make sure the component accepts the minimum necessary information in its props. For example, it could accept individual values instead of a whole object:\n\nEven individual values can sometimes be projected to ones that change less frequently. For example, here a component accepts a boolean indicating the presence of a value rather than the value itself:\n\nWhen you need to pass a function to memoized component, either declare it outside your component so that it never changes, or useCallback to cache its definition between re-renders.\n\nIn rare cases it may be infeasible to minimize the props changes of a memoized component. In that case, you can provide a custom comparison function, which React will use to compare the old and new props instead of using shallow equality. This function is passed as a second argument to memo. It should return true only if the new props would result in the same output as the old props; otherwise it should return false.\n\nIf you do this, use the Performance panel in your browser developer tools to make sure that your comparison function is actually faster than re-rendering the component. You might be surprised.\n\nWhen you do performance measurements, make sure that React is running in the production mode.\n\nIf you provide a custom arePropsEqual implementation, you must compare every prop, including functions. Functions often close over the props and state of parent components. If you return true when oldProps.onClick !== newProps.onClick, your component will keep “seeing” the props and state from a previous render inside its onClick handler, leading to very confusing bugs.\n\nAvoid doing deep equality checks inside arePropsEqual unless you are 100% sure that the data structure you’re working with has a known limited depth. Deep equality checks can become incredibly slow and can freeze your app for many seconds if someone changes the data structure later.\n\nWhen you enable React Compiler, you typically don’t need React.memo anymore. The compiler automatically optimizes component re-rendering for you.\n\nWithout React Compiler, you need React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders:\n\nWith React Compiler enabled, the same optimization happens automatically:\n\nHere’s the key part of what the React Compiler generates:\n\nNotice the highlighted lines: The compiler wraps <ExpensiveChild name=\"John\" /> in a cache check. Since the name prop is always \"John\", this JSX is created once and reused on every parent re-render. This is exactly what React.memo does - it prevents the child from re-rendering when its props haven’t changed.\n\nThe React Compiler automatically:\n\nThis means you can safely remove React.memo from your components when using React Compiler. The compiler provides the same optimization automatically, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.\n\nThe compiler’s optimization is actually more comprehensive than React.memo. It also memoizes intermediate values and expensive computations within your components, similar to combining React.memo with useMemo throughout your component tree.\n\nReact compares old and new props by shallow equality: that is, it considers whether each new prop is reference-equal to the old prop. If you create a new object or array each time the parent is re-rendered, even if the individual elements are each the same, React will still consider it to be changed. Similarly, if you create a new function when rendering the parent component, React will consider it to have changed even if the function has the same definition. To avoid this, simplify props or memoize props in the parent component.",
