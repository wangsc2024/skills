  "title": "useActionState",
  "content": "useActionState is a Hook that allows you to update state based on the result of a form action.\n\nIn earlier React Canary versions, this API was part of React DOM and called useFormState.\n\nCall useActionState at the top level of your component to create component state that is updated when a form action is invoked. You pass useActionState an existing form action function as well as an initial state, and it returns a new action that you use in your form, along with the latest form state and whether the Action is still pending. The latest form state is also passed to the function that you provided.\n\nThe form state is the value returned by the action when the form was last submitted. If the form has not yet been submitted, it is the initial state that you pass.\n\nIf used with a Server Function, useActionState allows the server’s response from submitting the form to be shown even before hydration has completed.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nuseActionState returns an array with the following values:\n\nCall useActionState at the top level of your component to access the return value of an action from the last time a form was submitted.\n\nuseActionState returns an array with the following items:\n\nWhen the form is submitted, the action function that you provided will be called. Its return value will become the new current state of the form.\n\nThe action that you provide will also receive a new first argument, namely the current state of the form. The first time the form is submitted, this will be the initial state you provided, while with subsequent submissions, it will be the return value from the last time the action was called. The rest of the arguments are the same as if useActionState had not been used.\n\nTo display messages such as an error message or toast that’s returned by a Server Function, wrap the action in a call to useActionState.\n\nWhen you wrap an action with useActionState, it gets an extra argument as its first argument. The submitted form data is therefore its second argument instead of its first as it would usually be. The new first argument that gets added is the current state of the form.",
