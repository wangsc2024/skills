  "content": "'use server' is for use with using React Server Components.\n\n'use server' marks server-side functions that can be called from client-side code.\n\nAdd 'use server' at the top of an async function body to mark the function as callable by the client. We call these functions Server Functions.\n\nWhen calling a Server Function on the client, it will make a network request to the server that includes a serialized copy of any arguments passed. If the Server Function returns a value, that value will be serialized and returned to the client.\n\nInstead of individually marking functions with 'use server', you can add the directive to the top of a file to mark all exports within that file as Server Functions that can be used anywhere, including imported in client code.\n\nArguments to Server Functions are fully client-controlled. For security, always treat them as untrusted input, and make sure to validate and escape arguments as appropriate.\n\nIn any Server Function, make sure to validate that the logged-in user is allowed to perform that action.\n\nTo prevent sending sensitive data from a Server Function, there are experimental taint APIs to prevent unique values and objects from being passed to client code.\n\nSee experimental_taintUniqueValue and experimental_taintObjectReference.\n\nSince client code calls the Server Function over the network, any arguments passed will need to be serializable.\n\nHere are supported types for Server Function arguments:\n\nNotably, these are not supported:\n\nSupported serializable return values are the same as serializable props for a boundary Client Component.\n\nThe most common use case of Server Functions will be calling functions that mutate data. On the browser, the HTML form element is the traditional approach for a user to submit a mutation. With React Server Components, React introduces first-class support for Server Functions as Actions in forms.\n\nHere is a form that allows a user to request a username.\n\nIn this example requestUsername is a Server Function passed to a <form>. When a user submits this form, there is a network request to the server function requestUsername. When calling a Server Function in a form, React will supply the form’s FormData as the first argument to the Server Function.\n\nBy passing a Server Function to the form action, React can progressively enhance the form. This means that forms can be submitted before the JavaScript bundle is loaded.\n\nIn the username request form, there might be the chance that a username is not available. requestUsername should tell us if it fails or not.\n\nTo update the UI based on the result of a Server Function while supporting progressive enhancement, use useActionState.\n\nNote that like most Hooks, useActionState can only be called in client code.\n\nServer Functions are exposed server endpoints and can be called anywhere in client code.\n\nWhen using a Server Function outside a form, call the Server Function in a Transition, which allows you to display a loading indicator, show optimistic state updates, and handle unexpected errors. Forms will automatically wrap Server Functions in transitions.\n\nTo read a Server Function return value, you’ll need to await the promise returned.",
