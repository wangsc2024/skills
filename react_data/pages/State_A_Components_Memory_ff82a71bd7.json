  "title": "State: A Component's Memory",
  "content": "Components often need to change what’s on the screen as a result of an interaction. Typing into the form should update the input field, clicking “next” on an image carousel should change which image is displayed, clicking “buy” should put a product in the shopping cart. Components need to “remember” things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping cart. In React, this kind of component-specific memory is called state.\n\nHere’s a component that renders a sculpture image. Clicking the “Next” button should show the next sculpture by changing the index to 1, then 2, and so on. However, this won’t work (you can try it!):\n\nThe handleClick event handler is updating a local variable, index. But two things prevent that change from being visible:\n\nTo update a component with new data, two things need to happen:\n\nThe useState Hook provides those two things:\n\nTo add a state variable, import useState from React at the top of the file:\n\nThen, replace this line:\n\nindex is a state variable and setIndex is the setter function.\n\nThe [ and ] syntax here is called array destructuring and it lets you read values from an array. The array returned by useState always has exactly two items.\n\nThis is how they work together in handleClick:\n\nNow clicking the “Next” button switches the current sculpture:\n\nIn React, useState, as well as any other function starting with “use”, is called a Hook.\n\nHooks are special functions that are only available while React is rendering (which we’ll get into in more detail on the next page). They let you “hook into” different React features.\n\nState is just one of those features, but you will meet the other Hooks later.\n\nHooks—functions starting with use—can only be called at the top level of your components or your own Hooks. You can’t call Hooks inside conditions, loops, or other nested functions. Hooks are functions, but it’s helpful to think of them as unconditional declarations about your component’s needs. You “use” React features at the top of your component similar to how you “import” modules at the top of your file.\n\nWhen you call useState, you are telling React that you want this component to remember something:\n\nIn this case, you want React to remember index.\n\nThe convention is to name this pair like const [something, setSomething]. You could name it anything you like, but conventions make things easier to understand across projects.\n\nThe only argument to useState is the initial value of your state variable. In this example, the index’s initial value is set to 0 with useState(0).\n\nEvery time your component renders, useState gives you an array containing two values:\n\nHere’s how that happens in action:\n\nYou can have as many state variables of as many types as you like in one component. This component has two state variables, a number index and a boolean showMore that’s toggled when you click “Show details”:\n\nIt is a good idea to have multiple state variables if their state is unrelated, like index and showMore in this example. But if you find that you often change two state variables together, it might be easier to combine them into one. For example, if you have a form with many fields, it’s more convenient to have a single state variable that holds an object than state variable per field. Read Choosing the State Structure for more tips.\n\nYou might have noticed that the useState call does not receive any information about which state variable it refers to. There is no “identifier” that is passed to useState, so how does it know which of the state variables to return? Does it rely on some magic like parsing your functions? The answer is no.\n\nInstead, to enable their concise syntax, Hooks rely on a stable call order on every render of the same component. This works well in practice because if you follow the rule above (“only call Hooks at the top level”), Hooks will always be called in the same order. Additionally, a linter plugin catches most mistakes.\n\nInternally, React holds an array of state pairs for every component. It also maintains the current pair index, which is set to 0 before rendering. Each time you call useState, React gives you the next state pair and increments the index. You can read more about this mechanism in React Hooks: Not Magic, Just Arrays.\n\nThis example doesn’t use React but it gives you an idea of how useState works internally:\n\nYou don’t have to understand it to use React, but you might find this a helpful mental model.\n\nState is local to a component instance on the screen. In other words, if you render the same component twice, each copy will have completely isolated state! Changing one of them will not affect the other.\n\nIn this example, the Gallery component from earlier is rendered twice with no changes to its logic. Try clicking the buttons inside each of the galleries. Notice that their state is independent:\n\nThis is what makes state different from regular variables that you might declare at the top of your module. State is not tied to a particular function call or a place in the code, but it’s “local” to the specific place on the screen. You rendered two <Gallery /> components, so their state is stored separately.\n\nAlso notice how the Page component doesn’t “know” anything about the Gallery state or even whether it has any. Unlike props, state is fully private to the component declaring it. The parent component can’t change it. This lets you add state to any component or remove it without impacting the rest of the components.\n\nWhat if you wanted both galleries to keep their states in sync? The right way to do it in React is to remove state from child components and add it to their closest shared parent. The next few pages will focus on organizing state of a single component, but we will return to this topic in Sharing State Between Components.\n\nWhen you press “Next” on the last sculpture, the code crashes. Fix the logic to prevent the crash. You may do this by adding extra logic to event handler or by disabling the button when the action is not possible.\n\nAfter fixing the crash, add a “Previous” button that shows the previous sculpture. It shouldn’t crash on the first sculpture.",
