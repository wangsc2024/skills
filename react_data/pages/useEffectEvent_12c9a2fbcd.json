  "content": "useEffectEvent is a React Hook that lets you extract non-reactive logic from your Effects into a reusable function called an Effect Event.\n\nCall useEffectEvent at the top level of your component to declare an Effect Event. Effect Events are functions you can call inside Effects, such as useEffect:\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nReturns an Effect Event function. You can call this function inside useEffect, useLayoutEffect, or useInsertionEffect.\n\nTypically, when you access a reactive value inside an Effect, you must include it in the dependency array. This makes sure your Effect runs again whenever that value changes, which is usually the desired behavior.\n\nBut in some cases, you may want to read the most recent props or state inside an Effect without causing the Effect to re-run when those values change.\n\nTo read the latest props or state in your Effect, without making those values reactive, include them in an Effect Event.\n\nIn this example, the Effect should re-run after a render when url changes (to log the new page visit), but it should not re-run when numberOfItems changes. By wrapping the logging logic in an Effect Event, numberOfItems becomes non-reactive. It’s always read from the latest value without triggering the Effect.\n\nYou can pass reactive values like url as arguments to the Effect Event to keep them reactive while accessing the latest non-reactive values inside the event.",
