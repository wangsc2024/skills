  "content": "Validates usage of Error Boundaries instead of try/catch for errors in child components.\n\nTry/catch blocks can’t catch errors that happen during React’s rendering process. Errors thrown in rendering methods or hooks bubble up through the component tree. Only Error Boundaries can catch these errors.\n\nExamples of incorrect code for this rule:\n\nExamples of correct code for this rule:\n\nThe use hook doesn’t throw errors in the traditional sense, it suspends component execution. When use encounters a pending promise, it suspends the component and lets React show a fallback. Only Suspense and Error Boundaries can handle these cases. The linter warns against try/catch around use to prevent confusion as the catch block would never run.",
