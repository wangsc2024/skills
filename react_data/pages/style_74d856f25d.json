  "content": "The built-in browser <style> component lets you add inline CSS stylesheets to your document.\n\nTo add inline styles to your document, render the built-in browser <style> component. You can render <style> from any component and React will in certain cases place the corresponding DOM element in the document head and de-duplicate identical styles.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\n<style> supports all common element props.\n\nProps that are not recommended for use with React:\n\nReact can move <style> components to the document’s <head>, de-duplicate identical stylesheets, and suspend while the stylesheet is loading.\n\nTo opt into this behavior, provide the href and precedence props. React will de-duplicate styles if they have the same href. The precedence prop tells React where to rank the <style> DOM node relative to others in the document <head>, which determines which stylesheet can override the other.\n\nThis special treatment comes with three caveats:\n\nIf a component depends on certain CSS styles in order to be displayed correctly, you can render an inline stylesheet within the component.\n\nThe href prop should uniquely identify the stylesheet, because React will de-duplicate stylesheets that have the same href. If you supply a precedence prop, React will reorder inline stylesheets based on the order these values appear in the component tree.\n\nInline stylesheets will not trigger Suspense boundaries while they’re loading. Even if they load async resources like fonts or images.",
