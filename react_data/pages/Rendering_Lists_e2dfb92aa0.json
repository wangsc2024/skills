  "content": "You will often want to display multiple similar components from a collection of data. You can use the JavaScript array methods to manipulate an array of data. On this page, you’ll use filter() and map() with React to filter and transform your array of data into an array of components.\n\nSay that you have a list of content.\n\nThe only difference among those list items is their contents, their data. You will often need to show several instances of the same component using different data when building interfaces: from lists of comments to galleries of profile images. In these situations, you can store that data in JavaScript objects and arrays and use methods like map() and filter() to render lists of components from them.\n\nHere’s a short example of how to generate a list of items from an array:\n\nNotice the sandbox above displays a console error:\n\nYou’ll learn how to fix this error later on this page. Before we get to that, let’s add some structure to your data.\n\nThis data can be structured even more.\n\nLet’s say you want a way to only show people whose profession is 'chemist'. You can use JavaScript’s filter() method to return just those people. This method takes an array of items, passes them through a “test” (a function that returns true or false), and returns a new array of only those items that passed the test (returned true).\n\nYou only want the items where profession is 'chemist'. The “test” function for this looks like (person) => person.profession === 'chemist'. Here’s how to put it together:\n\nArrow functions implicitly return the expression right after =>, so you didn’t need a return statement:\n\nHowever, you must write return explicitly if your => is followed by a { curly brace!\n\nArrow functions containing => { are said to have a “block body”. They let you write more than a single line of code, but you have to write a return statement yourself. If you forget it, nothing gets returned!\n\nNotice that all the sandboxes above show an error in the console:\n\nYou need to give each array item a key — a string or a number that uniquely identifies it among other items in that array:\n\nJSX elements directly inside a map() call always need keys!\n\nKeys tell React which array item each component corresponds to, so that it can match them up later. This becomes important if your array items can move (e.g. due to sorting), get inserted, or get deleted. A well-chosen key helps React infer what exactly has happened, and make the correct updates to the DOM tree.\n\nRather than generating keys on the fly, you should include them in your data:\n\nWhat do you do when each item needs to render not one, but several DOM nodes?\n\nThe short <>...</> Fragment syntax won’t let you pass a key, so you need to either group them into a single <div>, or use the slightly longer and more explicit <Fragment> syntax:\n\nFragments disappear from the DOM, so this will produce a flat list of <h1>, <p>, <h1>, <p>, and so on.\n\nDifferent sources of data provide different sources of keys:\n\nImagine that files on your desktop didn’t have names. Instead, you’d refer to them by their order — the first file, the second file, and so on. You could get used to it, but once you delete a file, it would get confusing. The second file would become the first file, the third file would be the second file, and so on.\n\nFile names in a folder and JSX keys in an array serve a similar purpose. They let us uniquely identify an item between its siblings. A well-chosen key provides more information than the position within the array. Even if the position changes due to reordering, the key lets React identify the item throughout its lifetime.\n\nYou might be tempted to use an item’s index in the array as its key. In fact, that’s what React will use if you don’t specify a key at all. But the order in which you render items will change over time if an item is inserted, deleted, or if the array gets reordered. Index as a key often leads to subtle and confusing bugs.\n\nSimilarly, do not generate keys on the fly, e.g. with key={Math.random()}. This will cause keys to never match up between renders, leading to all your components and DOM being recreated every time. Not only is this slow, but it will also lose any user input inside the list items. Instead, use a stable ID based on the data.\n\nNote that your components won’t receive key as a prop. It’s only used as a hint by React itself. If your component needs an ID, you have to pass it as a separate prop: <Profile key={id} userId={id} />.\n\nOn this page you learned:\n\nThis example shows a list of all people.\n\nChange it to show two separate lists one after another: Chemists and Everyone Else. Like previously, you can determine whether a person is a chemist by checking if person.profession === 'chemist'.",
