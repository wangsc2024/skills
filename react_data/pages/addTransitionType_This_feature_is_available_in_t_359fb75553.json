  "content": "The addTransitionType API is currently only available in React’s Canary and Experimental channels.\n\nLearn more about React’s release channels here.\n\naddTransitionType lets you specify the cause of a transition.\n\naddTransitionType does not return anything.\n\nCall addTransitionType inside of startTransition to indicate the cause of a transition:\n\nWhen you call addTransitionType inside the scope of startTransition, React will associate submit-click as one of the causes for the Transition.\n\nCurrently, Transition Types can be used to customize different animations based on what caused the Transition. You have three different ways to choose from for how to use them:\n\nIn the future, we plan to support more use cases for using the cause of a transition.\n\nWhen a ViewTransition activates from a transition, React adds all the Transition Types as browser view transition types to the element.\n\nThis allows you to customize different animations based on CSS scopes:\n\nYou can customize animations for an activated ViewTransition based on type by passing an object to the View Transition Class:\n\nIf multiple types match, then they’re joined together. If no types match then the special “default” entry is used instead. If any type has the value “none” then that wins and the ViewTransition is disabled (not assigned a name).\n\nThese can be combined with enter/exit/update/layout/share props to match based on kind of trigger and Transition Type.\n\nYou can imperatively customize animations for an activated ViewTransition based on type using View Transition events:\n\nThis allows you to pick different imperative Animations based on the cause.",
