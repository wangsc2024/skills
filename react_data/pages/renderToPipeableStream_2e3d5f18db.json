  "content": "renderToPipeableStream renders a React tree to a pipeable Node.js Stream.\n\nThis API is specific to Node.js. Environments with Web Streams, like Deno and modern edge runtimes, should use renderToReadableStream instead.\n\nCall renderToPipeableStream to render your React tree as HTML into a Node.js Stream.\n\nOn the client, call hydrateRoot to make the server-generated HTML interactive.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nreactNode: A React node you want to render to HTML. For example, a JSX element like <App />. It is expected to represent the entire document, so the App component should render the <html> tag.\n\noptional options: An object with streaming options.\n\nrenderToPipeableStream returns an object with two methods:\n\nCall renderToPipeableStream to render your React tree as HTML into a Node.js Stream:\n\nAlong with the root component, you need to provide a list of bootstrap <script> paths. Your root component should return the entire document including the root <html> tag.\n\nFor example, it might look like this:\n\nReact will inject the doctype and your bootstrap <script> tags into the resulting HTML stream:\n\nOn the client, your bootstrap script should hydrate the entire document with a call to hydrateRoot:\n\nThis will attach event listeners to the server-generated HTML and make it interactive.\n\nThe final asset URLs (like JavaScript and CSS files) are often hashed after the build. For example, instead of styles.css you might end up with styles.123456.css. Hashing static asset filenames guarantees that every distinct build of the same asset will have a different filename. This is useful because it lets you safely enable long-term caching for static assets: a file with a certain name would never change content.\n\nHowever, if you don’t know the asset URLs until after the build, there’s no way for you to put them in the source code. For example, hardcoding \"/styles.css\" into JSX like earlier wouldn’t work. To keep them out of your source code, your root component can read the real filenames from a map passed as a prop:\n\nOn the server, render <App assetMap={assetMap} /> and pass your assetMap with the asset URLs:\n\nSince your server is now rendering <App assetMap={assetMap} />, you need to render it with assetMap on the client too to avoid hydration errors. You can serialize and pass assetMap to the client like this:\n\nIn the example above, the bootstrapScriptContent option adds an extra inline <script> tag that sets the global window.assetMap variable on the client. This lets the client code read the same assetMap:\n\nBoth client and server render App with the same assetMap prop, so there are no hydration errors.\n\nStreaming allows the user to start seeing the content even before all the data has loaded on the server. For example, consider a profile page that shows a cover, a sidebar with friends and photos, and a list of posts:\n\nImagine that loading data for <Posts /> takes some time. Ideally, you’d want to show the rest of the profile page content to the user without waiting for the posts. To do this, wrap Posts in a <Suspense> boundary:\n\nThis tells React to start streaming the HTML before Posts loads its data. React will send the HTML for the loading fallback (PostsGlimmer) first, and then, when Posts finishes loading its data, React will send the remaining HTML along with an inline <script> tag that replaces the loading fallback with that HTML. From the user’s perspective, the page will first appear with the PostsGlimmer, later replaced by the Posts.\n\nYou can further nest <Suspense> boundaries to create a more granular loading sequence:\n\nIn this example, React can start streaming the page even earlier. Only ProfileLayout and ProfileCover must finish rendering first because they are not wrapped in any <Suspense> boundary. However, if Sidebar, Friends, or Photos need to load some data, React will send the HTML for the BigSpinner fallback instead. Then, as more data becomes available, more content will continue to be revealed until all of it becomes visible.\n\nStreaming does not need to wait for React itself to load in the browser, or for your app to become interactive. The HTML content from the server will get progressively revealed before any of the <script> tags load.\n\nRead more about how streaming HTML works.\n\nOnly Suspense-enabled data sources will activate the Suspense component. They include:\n\nSuspense does not detect when data is fetched inside an Effect or event handler.\n\nThe exact way you would load data in the Posts component above depends on your framework. If you use a Suspense-enabled framework, you’ll find the details in its data fetching documentation.\n\nSuspense-enabled data fetching without the use of an opinionated framework is not yet supported. The requirements for implementing a Suspense-enabled data source are unstable and undocumented. An official API for integrating data sources with Suspense will be released in a future version of React.\n\nThe part of your app outside of any <Suspense> boundaries is called the shell:\n\nIt determines the earliest loading state that the user may see:\n\nIf you wrap the whole app into a <Suspense> boundary at the root, the shell will only contain that spinner. However, that’s not a pleasant user experience because seeing a big spinner on the screen can feel slower and more annoying than waiting a bit more and seeing the real layout. This is why usually you’ll want to place the <Suspense> boundaries so that the shell feels minimal but complete—like a skeleton of the entire page layout.\n\nThe onShellReady callback fires when the entire shell has been rendered. Usually, you’ll start streaming then:\n\nBy the time onShellReady fires, components in nested <Suspense> boundaries might still be loading data.\n\nBy default, all errors on the server are logged to console. You can override this behavior to log crash reports:\n\nIf you provide a custom onError implementation, don’t forget to also log errors to the console like above.\n\nIn this example, the shell contains ProfileLayout, ProfileCover, and PostsGlimmer:\n\nIf an error occurs while rendering those components, React won’t have any meaningful HTML to send to the client. Override onShellError to send a fallback HTML that doesn’t rely on server rendering as the last resort:\n\nIf there is an error while generating the shell, both onError and onShellError will fire. Use onError for error reporting and use onShellError to send the fallback HTML document. Your fallback HTML does not have to be an error page. Instead, you may include an alternative shell that renders your app on the client only.\n\nIn this example, the <Posts /> component is wrapped in <Suspense> so it is not a part of the shell:\n\nIf an error happens in the Posts component or somewhere inside it, React will try to recover from it:\n\nIf retrying rendering Posts on the client also fails, React will throw the error on the client. As with all the errors thrown during rendering, the closest parent error boundary determines how to present the error to the user. In practice, this means that the user will see a loading indicator until it is certain that the error is not recoverable.\n\nIf retrying rendering Posts on the client succeeds, the loading fallback from the server will be replaced with the client rendering output. The user will not know that there was a server error. However, the server onError callback and the client onRecoverableError callbacks will fire so that you can get notified about the error.\n\nStreaming introduces a tradeoff. You want to start streaming the page as early as possible so that the user can see the content sooner. However, once you start streaming, you can no longer set the response status code.\n\nBy dividing your app into the shell (above all <Suspense> boundaries) and the rest of the content, you’ve already solved a part of this problem. If the shell errors, you’ll get the onShellError callback which lets you set the error status code. Otherwise, you know that the app may recover on the client, so you can send “OK”.\n\nIf a component outside the shell (i.e. inside a <Suspense> boundary) throws an error, React will not stop rendering. This means that the onError callback will fire, but you will still get onShellReady instead of onShellError. This is because React will try to recover from that error on the client, as described above.\n\nHowever, if you’d like, you can use the fact that something has errored to set the status code:\n\nThis will only catch errors outside the shell that happened while generating the initial shell content, so it’s not exhaustive. If knowing whether an error occurred for some content is critical, you can move it up into the shell.\n\nYou can create your own Error subclasses and use the instanceof operator to check which error is thrown. For example, you can define a custom NotFoundError and throw it from your component. Then your onError, onShellReady, and onShellError callbacks can do something different depending on the error type:\n\nKeep in mind that once you emit the shell and start streaming, you can’t change the status code.\n\nStreaming offers a better user experience because the user can see the content as it becomes available.\n\nHowever, when a crawler visits your page, or if you’re generating the pages at the build time, you might want to let all of the content load first and then produce the final HTML output instead of revealing it progressively.\n\nYou can wait for all the content to load using the onAllReady callback:\n\nA regular visitor will get a stream of progressively loaded content. A crawler will receive the final HTML output after all the data loads. However, this also means that the crawler will have to wait for all data, some of which might be slow to load or error. Depending on your app, you could choose to send the shell to the crawlers too.\n\nYou can force the server rendering to “give up” after a timeout:\n\nReact will flush the remaining loading fallbacks as HTML, and will attempt to render the rest on the client.",
