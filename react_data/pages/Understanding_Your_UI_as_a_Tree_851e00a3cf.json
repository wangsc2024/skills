  "title": "Understanding Your UI as a Tree",
  "content": "Your React app is taking shape with many components being nested within each other. How does React keep track of your app’s component structure?\n\nReact, and many other UI libraries, model UI as a tree. Thinking of your app as a tree is useful for understanding the relationship between components. This understanding will help you debug future concepts like performance and state management.\n\nTrees are a relationship model between items. The UI is often represented using tree structures. For example, browsers use tree structures to model HTML (DOM) and CSS (CSSOM). Mobile platforms also use trees to represent their view hierarchy.\n\nReact creates a UI tree from your components. In this example, the UI tree is then used to render to the DOM.\n\nLike browsers and mobile platforms, React also uses tree structures to manage and model the relationship between components in a React app. These trees are useful tools to understand how data flows through a React app and how to optimize rendering and app size.\n\nA major feature of components is the ability to compose components of other components. As we nest components, we have the concept of parent and child components, where each parent component may itself be a child of another component.\n\nWhen we render a React app, we can model this relationship in a tree, known as the render tree.\n\nHere is a React app that renders inspirational quotes.\n\nReact creates a render tree, a UI tree, composed of the rendered components.\n\nFrom the example app, we can construct the above render tree.\n\nThe tree is composed of nodes, each of which represents a component. App, FancyText, Copyright, to name a few, are all nodes in our tree.\n\nThe root node in a React render tree is the root component of the app. In this case, the root component is App and it is the first component React renders. Each arrow in the tree points from a parent component to a child component.\n\nYou’ll notice in the above render tree, there is no mention of the HTML tags that each component renders. This is because the render tree is only composed of React components.\n\nReact, as a UI framework, is platform agnostic. On react.dev, we showcase examples that render to the web, which uses HTML markup as its UI primitives. But a React app could just as likely render to a mobile or desktop platform, which may use different UI primitives like UIView or FrameworkElement.\n\nThese platform UI primitives are not a part of React. React render trees can provide insight to our React app regardless of what platform your app renders to.\n\nA render tree represents a single render pass of a React application. With conditional rendering, a parent component may render different children depending on the data passed.\n\nWe can update the app to conditionally render either an inspirational quote or color.\n\nWith conditional rendering, across different renders, the render tree may render different components.\n\nIn this example, depending on what inspiration.type is, we may render <FancyText> or <Color>. The render tree may be different for each render pass.\n\nAlthough render trees may differ across render passes, these trees are generally helpful for identifying what the top-level and leaf components are in a React app. Top-level components are the components nearest to the root component and affect the rendering performance of all the components beneath them and often contain the most complexity. Leaf components are near the bottom of the tree and have no child components and are often frequently re-rendered.\n\nIdentifying these categories of components are useful for understanding data flow and performance of your app.\n\nAnother relationship in a React app that can be modeled with a tree are an app’s module dependencies. As we break up our components and logic into separate files, we create JS modules where we may export components, functions, or constants.\n\nEach node in a module dependency tree is a module and each branch represents an import statement in that module.\n\nIf we take the previous Inspirations app, we can build a module dependency tree, or dependency tree for short.\n\nThe module dependency tree for the Inspirations app.\n\nThe root node of the tree is the root module, also known as the entrypoint file. It often is the module that contains the root component.\n\nComparing to the render tree of the same app, there are similar structures but some notable differences:\n\nDependency trees are useful to determine what modules are necessary to run your React app. When building a React app for production, there is typically a build step that will bundle all the necessary JavaScript to ship to the client. The tool responsible for this is called a bundler, and bundlers will use the dependency tree to determine what modules should be included.\n\nAs your app grows, often the bundle size does too. Large bundle sizes are expensive for a client to download and run. Large bundle sizes can delay the time for your UI to get drawn. Getting a sense of your app’s dependency tree may help with debugging these issues.",
