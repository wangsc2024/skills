For an introduction to React, please visit the Learn section.\n\nThe React reference documentation is broken down into functional subsections:\n\nProgrammatic React features:\n\nReact DOM contains features that are only supported for web applications (which run in the browser DOM environment). This section is broken into the following:\n\nThe React Compiler is a build-time optimization tool that automatically memoizes your React components and values:\n\nThe ESLint plugin for React Hooks helps enforce the Rules of React:\n\nReact has idioms — or rules — for how to express patterns in a way that is easy to understand and yields high-quality applications:",
