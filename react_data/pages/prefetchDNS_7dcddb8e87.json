  "content": "prefetchDNS lets you eagerly look up the IP of a server that you expect to load resources from.\n\nTo look up a host, call the prefetchDNS function from react-dom.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nThe prefetchDNS function provides the browser with a hint that it should look up the IP address of a given server. If the browser chooses to do so, this can speed up the loading of resources from that server.\n\nprefetchDNS returns nothing.\n\nCall prefetchDNS when rendering a component if you know that its children will load external resources from that host.\n\nCall prefetchDNS in an event handler before transitioning to a page or state where external resources will be needed. This gets the process started earlier than if you call it during the rendering of the new page or state.",
