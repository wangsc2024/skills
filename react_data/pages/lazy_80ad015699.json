  "content": "lazy lets you defer loading component’s code until it is rendered for the first time.\n\nCall lazy outside your components to declare a lazy-loaded React component:\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nlazy returns a React component you can render in your tree. While the code for the lazy component is still loading, attempting to render it will suspend. Use <Suspense> to display a loading indicator while it’s loading.\n\nload receives no parameters.\n\nYou need to return a Promise or some other thenable (a Promise-like object with a then method). It needs to eventually resolve to an object whose .default property is a valid React component type, such as a function, memo, or a forwardRef component.\n\nUsually, you import components with the static import declaration:\n\nTo defer loading this component’s code until it’s rendered for the first time, replace this import with:\n\nThis code relies on dynamic import(), which might require support from your bundler or framework. Using this pattern requires that the lazy component you’re importing was exported as the default export.\n\nNow that your component’s code loads on demand, you also need to specify what should be displayed while it is loading. You can do this by wrapping the lazy component or any of its parents into a <Suspense> boundary:\n\nIn this example, the code for MarkdownPreview won’t be loaded until you attempt to render it. If MarkdownPreview hasn’t loaded yet, Loading will be shown in its place. Try ticking the checkbox:\n\nThis demo loads with an artificial delay. The next time you untick and tick the checkbox, Preview will be cached, so there will be no loading state. To see the loading state again, click “Reset” on the sandbox.\n\nLearn more about managing loading states with Suspense.\n\nDo not declare lazy components inside other components:\n\nInstead, always declare them at the top level of your module:",
