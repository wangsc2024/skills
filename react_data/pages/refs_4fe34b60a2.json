  "content": "Validates correct usage of refs, not reading/writing during render. See the “pitfalls” section in useRef() usage.\n\nRefs hold values that aren’t used for rendering. Unlike state, changing a ref doesn’t trigger a re-render. Reading or writing ref.current during render breaks React’s expectations. Refs might not be initialized when you try to read them, and their values can be stale or inconsistent.\n\nThe lint only applies these rules to values it knows are refs. A value is inferred as a ref when the compiler sees any of the following patterns:\n\nReturned from useRef() or React.createRef().\n\nAn identifier named ref or ending in Ref that reads from or writes to .current.\n\nPassed through a JSX ref prop (for example <div ref={someRef} />).\n\nOnce something is marked as a ref, that inference follows the value through assignments, destructuring, or helper calls. This lets the lint surface violations even when ref.current is accessed inside another function that received the ref as an argument.\n\nExamples of incorrect code for this rule:\n\nExamples of correct code for this rule:\n\nThe name heuristic intentionally treats ref.current and fooRef.current as real refs. If you’re modeling a custom container object, pick a different name (for example, box) or move the mutable value into state. Renaming avoids the lint because the compiler stops inferring it as a ref.",
