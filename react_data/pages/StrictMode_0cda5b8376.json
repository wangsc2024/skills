  "content": "<StrictMode> lets you find common bugs in your components early during development.\n\nUse StrictMode to enable additional development behaviors and warnings for the component tree inside:\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nStrict Mode enables the following development-only behaviors:\n\nStrictMode accepts no props.\n\nStrict Mode enables extra development-only checks for the entire component tree inside the <StrictMode> component. These checks help you find common bugs in your components early in the development process.\n\nTo enable Strict Mode for your entire app, wrap your root component with <StrictMode> when you render it:\n\nWe recommend wrapping your entire app in Strict Mode, especially for newly created apps. If you use a framework that calls createRoot for you, check its documentation for how to enable Strict Mode.\n\nAlthough the Strict Mode checks only run in development, they help you find bugs that already exist in your code but can be tricky to reliably reproduce in production. Strict Mode lets you fix bugs before your users report them.\n\nStrict Mode enables the following checks in development:\n\nAll of these checks are development-only and do not impact the production build.\n\nYou can also enable Strict Mode for any part of your application:\n\nIn this example, Strict Mode checks will not run against the Header and Footer components. However, they will run on Sidebar and Content, as well as all of the components inside them, no matter how deep.\n\nWhen StrictMode is enabled for a part of the app, React will only enable behaviors that are possible in production. For example, if <StrictMode> is not enabled at the root of the app, it will not re-run Effects an extra time on initial mount, since this would cause child effects to double fire without the parent effects, which cannot happen in production.\n\nReact assumes that every component you write is a pure function. This means that React components you write must always return the same JSX given the same inputs (props, state, and context).\n\nComponents breaking this rule behave unpredictably and cause bugs. To help you find accidentally impure code, Strict Mode calls some of your functions (only the ones that should be pure) twice in development. This includes:\n\nIf a function is pure, running it twice does not change its behavior because a pure function produces the same result every time. However, if a function is impure (for example, it mutates the data it receives), running it twice tends to be noticeable (that’s what makes it impure!) This helps you spot and fix the bug early.\n\nHere is an example to illustrate how double rendering in Strict Mode helps you find bugs early.\n\nThis StoryTray component takes an array of stories and adds one last “Create Story” item at the end:\n\nThere is a mistake in the code above. However, it is easy to miss because the initial output appears correct.\n\nThis mistake will become more noticeable if the StoryTray component re-renders multiple times. For example, let’s make the StoryTray re-render with a different background color whenever you hover over it:\n\nNotice how every time you hover over the StoryTray component, “Create Story” gets added to the list again. The intention of the code was to add it once at the end. But StoryTray directly modifies the stories array from the props. Every time StoryTray renders, it adds “Create Story” again at the end of the same array. In other words, StoryTray is not a pure function—running it multiple times produces different results.\n\nTo fix this problem, you can make a copy of the array, and modify that copy instead of the original one:\n\nThis would make the StoryTray function pure. Each time it is called, it would only modify a new copy of the array, and would not affect any external objects or variables. This solves the bug, but you had to make the component re-render more often before it became obvious that something is wrong with its behavior.\n\nIn the original example, the bug wasn’t obvious. Now let’s wrap the original (buggy) code in <StrictMode>:\n\nStrict Mode always calls your rendering function twice, so you can see the mistake right away (“Create Story” appears twice). This lets you notice such mistakes early in the process. When you fix your component to render in Strict Mode, you also fix many possible future production bugs like the hover functionality from before:\n\nWithout Strict Mode, it was easy to miss the bug until you added more re-renders. Strict Mode made the same bug appear right away. Strict Mode helps you find bugs before you push them to your team and to your users.\n\nRead more about keeping components pure.\n\nIf you have React DevTools installed, any console.log calls during the second render call will appear slightly dimmed. React DevTools also offers a setting (off by default) to suppress them completely.\n\nStrict Mode can also help find bugs in Effects.\n\nEvery Effect has some setup code and may have some cleanup code. Normally, React calls setup when the component mounts (is added to the screen) and calls cleanup when the component unmounts (is removed from the screen). React then calls cleanup and setup again if its dependencies changed since the last render.\n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, React will also run one extra setup+cleanup cycle in development for every Effect. This may feel surprising, but it helps reveal subtle bugs that are hard to catch manually.\n\nHere is an example to illustrate how re-running Effects in Strict Mode helps you find bugs early.\n\nConsider this example that connects a component to a chat:\n\nThere is an issue with this code, but it might not be immediately clear.\n\nTo make the issue more obvious, let’s implement a feature. In the example below, roomId is not hardcoded. Instead, the user can select the roomId that they want to connect to from a dropdown. Click “Open chat” and then select different chat rooms one by one. Keep track of the number of active connections in the console:\n\nYou’ll notice that the number of open connections always keeps growing. In a real app, this would cause performance and network problems. The issue is that your Effect is missing a cleanup function:\n\nNow that your Effect “cleans up” after itself and destroys the outdated connections, the leak is solved. However, notice that the problem did not become visible until you’ve added more features (the select box).\n\nIn the original example, the bug wasn’t obvious. Now let’s wrap the original (buggy) code in <StrictMode>:\n\nWith Strict Mode, you immediately see that there is a problem (the number of active connections jumps to 2). Strict Mode runs an extra setup+cleanup cycle for every Effect. This Effect has no cleanup logic, so it creates an extra connection but doesn’t destroy it. This is a hint that you’re missing a cleanup function.\n\nStrict Mode lets you notice such mistakes early in the process. When you fix your Effect by adding a cleanup function in Strict Mode, you also fix many possible future production bugs like the select box from before:\n\nNotice how the active connection count in the console doesn’t keep growing anymore.\n\nWithout Strict Mode, it was easy to miss that your Effect needed cleanup. By running setup → cleanup → setup instead of setup for your Effect in development, Strict Mode made the missing cleanup logic more noticeable.\n\nRead more about implementing Effect cleanup.\n\nStrict Mode can also help find bugs in callbacks refs.\n\nEvery callback ref has some setup code and may have some cleanup code. Normally, React calls setup when the element is created (is added to the DOM) and calls cleanup when the element is removed (is removed from the DOM).\n\nWhen Strict Mode is on, React will also run one extra setup+cleanup cycle in development for every callback ref. This may feel surprising, but it helps reveal subtle bugs that are hard to catch manually.\n\nConsider this example, which allows you to select an animal and then scroll to one of them. Notice when you switch from “Cats” to “Dogs”, the console logs show that the number of animals in the list keeps growing, and the “Scroll to” buttons stop working:\n\nThis is a production bug! Since the ref callback doesn’t remove animals from the list in the cleanup, the list of animals keeps growing. This is a memory leak that can cause performance problems in a real app, and breaks the behavior of the app.\n\nThe issue is the ref callback doesn’t cleanup after itself:\n\nNow let’s wrap the original (buggy) code in <StrictMode>:\n\nWith Strict Mode, you immediately see that there is a problem. Strict Mode runs an extra setup+cleanup cycle for every callback ref. This callback ref has no cleanup logic, so it adds refs but doesn’t remove them. This is a hint that you’re missing a cleanup function.\n\nStrict Mode lets you eagerly find mistakes in callback refs. When you fix your callback by adding a cleanup function in Strict Mode, you also fix many possible future production bugs like the “Scroll to” bug from before:\n\nNow on inital mount in StrictMode, the ref callbacks are all setup, cleaned up, and setup again:\n\nThis is expected. Strict Mode confirms that the ref callbacks are cleaned up correctly, so the size never grows above the expected amount. After the fix, there are no memory leaks, and all the features work as expected.\n\nWithout Strict Mode, it was easy to miss the bug until you clicked around to app to notice broken features. Strict Mode made the bugs appear right away, before you push them to production.\n\nReact warns if some component anywhere inside a <StrictMode> tree uses one of these deprecated APIs:\n\nThese APIs are primarily used in older class components so they rarely appear in modern apps.",
