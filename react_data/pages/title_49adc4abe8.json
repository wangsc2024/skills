  "content": "The built-in browser <title> component lets you specify the title of the document.\n\nTo specify the title of the document, render the built-in browser <title> component. You can render <title> from any component and React will always place the corresponding DOM element in the document head.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\n<title> supports all common element props.\n\nReact will always place the DOM element corresponding to the <title> component within the document’s <head>, regardless of where in the React tree it is rendered. The <head> is the only valid place for <title> to exist within the DOM, yet it’s convenient and keeps things composable if a component representing a specific page can render its <title> itself.\n\nThere are two exception to this:\n\nOnly render a single <title> at a time. If more than one component renders a <title> tag at the same time, React will place all of those titles in the document head. When this happens, the behavior of browsers and search engines is undefined.\n\nRender the <title> component from any component with text as its children. React will put a <title> DOM node in the document <head>.\n\nThe children of the <title> component must be a single string of text. (Or a single number or a single object with a toString method.) It might not be obvious, but using JSX curly braces like this:\n\n… actually causes the <title> component to get a two-element array as its children (the string \"Results page\" and the value of pageNumber). This will cause an error. Instead, use string interpolation to pass <title> a single string:",
