  "content": "useDeferredValue is a React Hook that lets you defer updating a part of the UI.\n\nCall useDeferredValue at the top level of your component to get a deferred version of that value.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nWhen an update is inside a Transition, useDeferredValue always returns the new value and does not spawn a deferred render, since the update is already deferred.\n\nThe values you pass to useDeferredValue should either be primitive values (like strings and numbers) or objects created outside of rendering. If you create a new object during rendering and immediately pass it to useDeferredValue, it will be different on every render, causing unnecessary background re-renders.\n\nWhen useDeferredValue receives a different value (compared with Object.is), in addition to the current render (when it still uses the previous value), it schedules a re-render in the background with the new value. The background re-render is interruptible: if there’s another update to the value, React will restart the background re-render from scratch. For example, if the user is typing into an input faster than a chart receiving its deferred value can re-render, the chart will only re-render after the user stops typing.\n\nuseDeferredValue is integrated with <Suspense>. If the background update caused by a new value suspends the UI, the user will not see the fallback. They will see the old deferred value until the data loads.\n\nuseDeferredValue does not by itself prevent extra network requests.\n\nThere is no fixed delay caused by useDeferredValue itself. As soon as React finishes the original re-render, React will immediately start working on the background re-render with the new deferred value. Any updates caused by events (like typing) will interrupt the background re-render and get prioritized over it.\n\nThe background re-render caused by useDeferredValue does not fire Effects until it’s committed to the screen. If the background re-render suspends, its Effects will run after the data loads and the UI updates.\n\nCall useDeferredValue at the top level of your component to defer updating some part of your UI.\n\nDuring the initial render, the deferred value will be the same as the value you provided.\n\nDuring updates, the deferred value will “lag behind” the latest value. In particular, React will first re-render without updating the deferred value, and then try to re-render with the newly received value in the background.\n\nLet’s walk through an example to see when this is useful.\n\nThis example assumes you use a Suspense-enabled data source:\n\nLearn more about Suspense and its limitations.\n\nIn this example, the SearchResults component suspends while fetching the search results. Try typing \"a\", waiting for the results, and then editing it to \"ab\". The results for \"a\" get replaced by the loading fallback.\n\nA common alternative UI pattern is to defer updating the list of results and to keep showing the previous results until the new results are ready. Call useDeferredValue to pass a deferred version of the query down:\n\nThe query will update immediately, so the input will display the new value. However, the deferredQuery will keep its previous value until the data has loaded, so SearchResults will show the stale results for a bit.\n\nEnter \"a\" in the example below, wait for the results to load, and then edit the input to \"ab\". Notice how instead of the Suspense fallback, you now see the stale result list until the new results have loaded:\n\nYou can think of it as happening in two steps:\n\nFirst, React re-renders with the new query (\"ab\") but with the old deferredQuery (still \"a\"). The deferredQuery value, which you pass to the result list, is deferred: it “lags behind” the query value.\n\nIn the background, React tries to re-render with both query and deferredQuery updated to \"ab\". If this re-render completes, React will show it on the screen. However, if it suspends (the results for \"ab\" have not loaded yet), React will abandon this rendering attempt, and retry this re-render again after the data has loaded. The user will keep seeing the stale deferred value until the data is ready.\n\nThe deferred “background” rendering is interruptible. For example, if you type into the input again, React will abandon it and restart with the new value. React will always use the latest provided value.\n\nNote that there is still a network request per each keystroke. What’s being deferred here is displaying results (until they’re ready), not the network requests themselves. Even if the user continues typing, responses for each keystroke get cached, so pressing Backspace is instant and doesn’t fetch again.\n\nIn the example above, there is no indication that the result list for the latest query is still loading. This can be confusing to the user if the new results take a while to load. To make it more obvious to the user that the result list does not match the latest query, you can add a visual indication when the stale result list is displayed:\n\nWith this change, as soon as you start typing, the stale result list gets slightly dimmed until the new result list loads. You can also add a CSS transition to delay dimming so that it feels gradual, like in the example below:\n\nYou can also apply useDeferredValue as a performance optimization. It is useful when a part of your UI is slow to re-render, there’s no easy way to optimize it, and you want to prevent it from blocking the rest of the UI.\n\nImagine you have a text field and a component (like a chart or a long list) that re-renders on every keystroke:\n\nFirst, optimize SlowList to skip re-rendering when its props are the same. To do this, wrap it in memo:\n\nHowever, this only helps if the SlowList props are the same as during the previous render. The problem you’re facing now is that it’s slow when they’re different, and when you actually need to show different visual output.\n\nConcretely, the main performance problem is that whenever you type into the input, the SlowList receives new props, and re-rendering its entire tree makes the typing feel janky. In this case, useDeferredValue lets you prioritize updating the input (which must be fast) over updating the result list (which is allowed to be slower):\n\nThis does not make re-rendering of the SlowList faster. However, it tells React that re-rendering the list can be deprioritized so that it doesn’t block the keystrokes. The list will “lag behind” the input and then “catch up”. Like before, React will attempt to update the list as soon as possible, but will not block the user from typing.\n\nIn this example, each item in the SlowList component is artificially slowed down so that you can see how useDeferredValue lets you keep the input responsive. Type into the input and notice that typing feels snappy while the list “lags behind” it.\n\nThis optimization requires SlowList to be wrapped in memo. This is because whenever the text changes, React needs to be able to re-render the parent component quickly. During that re-render, deferredText still has its previous value, so SlowList is able to skip re-rendering (its props have not changed). Without memo, it would have to re-render anyway, defeating the point of the optimization.\n\nThere are two common optimization techniques you might have used before in this scenario:\n\nWhile these techniques are helpful in some cases, useDeferredValue is better suited to optimizing rendering because it is deeply integrated with React itself and adapts to the user’s device.\n\nUnlike debouncing or throttling, it doesn’t require choosing any fixed delay. If the user’s device is fast (e.g. powerful laptop), the deferred re-render would happen almost immediately and wouldn’t be noticeable. If the user’s device is slow, the list would “lag behind” the input proportionally to how slow the device is.\n\nAlso, unlike with debouncing or throttling, deferred re-renders done by useDeferredValue are interruptible by default. This means that if React is in the middle of re-rendering a large list, but the user makes another keystroke, React will abandon that re-render, handle the keystroke, and then start rendering in the background again. By contrast, debouncing and throttling still produce a janky experience because they’re blocking: they merely postpone the moment when rendering blocks the keystroke.\n\nIf the work you’re optimizing doesn’t happen during rendering, debouncing and throttling are still useful. For example, they can let you fire fewer network requests. You can also use these techniques together.",
