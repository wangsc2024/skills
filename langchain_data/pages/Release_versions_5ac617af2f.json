When we refer to a minor version, such as v0.3, we always mean its latest available patch release (v0.3.x).\n\nDuring the support window for each version:\n\n* **Active Support**: Regular patch releases with bug fixes, regressions, and new features\n* **Critical Support**: Security-only releases for critical fixes related to security and installation\n* **End of Life**: No new patches released\n\n* **Stay Current**: We recommend upgrading to the latest minor version to receive full support and access to new features\n* **Plan Upgrades**: Monitor the changelog for upcoming version changes and plan upgrades accordingly\n* **Security**: Critical security fixes are only provided for Active and Critical support versions\n* **Testing**: Test your applications with newer versions before upgrading in production\n\n## Version compatibility\n\nWhen upgrading between minor versions:\n\n* Review the changelog for breaking changes\n* Test your applications thoroughly\n* Follow the upgrade guides provided in the documentation\n* Consider the support timeline for your current version\n\n## Current version support\n\nTo check the current supported versions and their support levels, refer to the [Agent Server Changelog](/langsmith/agent-server-changelog) for the latest release information.\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/release-versions.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
