  "content": "Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/log-traces-to-project\n\nYou can change the destination project of your traces both statically through environment variables and dynamically at runtime.\n\n## Set the destination project statically\n\nAs mentioned in the [Tracing Concepts](/langsmith/observability-concepts#projects) section, LangSmith uses the concept of a `Project` to group traces. If left unspecified, the project is set to `default`. You can set the `LANGSMITH_PROJECT` environment variable to configure a custom project name for an entire application run. This should be done before executing your application.\n\n<Warning>\n  The `LANGSMITH_PROJECT` flag is only supported in JS SDK versions >= 0.2.16, use `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT` instead if you are using an older version.\n</Warning>\n\nIf the project specified does not exist, it will be created automatically when the first trace is ingested.\n\n## Set the destination project dynamically\n\nYou can also set the project name at program runtime in various ways, depending on how you are [annotating your code for tracing](/langsmith/annotate-code). This is useful when you want to log traces to different projects within the same application.\n\n<Note>\n  Setting the project name dynamically using one of the below methods overrides the project name set by the `LANGSMITH_PROJECT` environment variable.\n</Note>\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/log-traces-to-project.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
