A Sidecar configuration is useful here because we require access to every container's filesystem. A DaemonSet can also be used.\n\n<Info>\n  **This configuration requires 'get', 'list', and 'watch' permissions on pods in the given namespace.**\n</Info>\n\nMetrics can be scraped using the Prometheus endpoints. A single instance ***Gateway*** collector can be be used to avoid duplication of queries when fetching metrics. The following config scrapes all of the default named LangSmith services:\n\n<Info>\n  **This configuration requires 'get', 'list', and 'watch' permissions on pods, services and endpoints in the given namespace.**\n</Info>\n\nFor traces, you need to enable the OTLP receiver.

When the soft limit is crossed, the collector stops accepting new data.\n* [Kubernetes Attributes Processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/k8sattributesprocessor): Adds Kubernetes metadata such as pod name into the telemetry data.\n\nExporters just need to point to an external endpoint of your liking. The following configuration allows you to configure a separate endpoint for logs, metrics and traces:\n\n<Note>\n  **The OTel Collector also supports exporting directly to a [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/opentelemetry/setup/collector_exporter) endpoint.**\n</Note>",
