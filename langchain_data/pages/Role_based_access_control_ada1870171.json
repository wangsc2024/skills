If you are interested in this feature, [contact our sales team](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales). Other plans default to using the Admin role for all users.\n</Note>\n\nLangSmith's RBAC system manages user permissions within workspaces. RBAC allows you to control who can access your LangSmith [workspace](/langsmith/administration-overview#workspaces) and what they can do within it.\n\nIn LangSmith, each user has:\n\n* One [**organization role**](#organization-roles) that applies across the entire organization (separate from workspace RBAC).\n  * The Organization User and Organization Viewer roles are only available in organizations on [plans](https://langchain.com/pricing) with multiple workspaces. In organizations limited to a single workspace, all users have the Organization Admin role.\n* One [**workspace role**](#workspace-roles) per workspace they're a member of (requires Enterprise RBAC feature).\n\nOn Enterprise plans, organizations can create [custom workspace roles](#custom-roles) with granular permission combinations.\n\nTo learn how to set up RBAC and assign roles to users, refer to the [User Management guide](/langsmith/user-management#set-up-access-control).\n\n<Note>\n  For a comprehensive list of required permissions along with the operations and roles that can perform them, refer to the [Organization and workspace reference](/langsmith/organization-workspace-operations).\n</Note>\n\n### Organization roles\n\nOrganization roles are **distinct from the workspace RBAC feature** and are used to manage organization-wide capabilities. The roles are system-defined and cannot be modified or extended. These roles are available in multi-workspace organizations on [Plus and Enterprise plans](https://langchain.com/pricing).\n\n| Role                                        | Description                                                                           |\n| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [Organization Admin](#organization-admin)   | Full permissions to manage organization configuration, users, billing, and workspaces |\n| [Organization User](#organization-user)     | Read access to organization information and ability to create personal access tokens  |\n| [Organization Viewer](#organization-viewer) | Read-only access to organization information                                          |\n\n<Note>\n  In organizations limited to a single workspace, all users are [Organization Admins](#organization-admin).\n</Note>\n\n#### Organization Admin\n\n**Description**: Full permissions to manage all organization configuration, users, billing, and workspaces.\n\n* `organization:manage` -

Navigate to Organization **Settings** > **Roles**.\n2. Click **Create Custom Role**.\n3. Select the permissions to include in the role.\n4. Assign the custom role to users in specific workspaces.\n\nFor details on which specific permissions are required for each operation, refer to the [Organization and workspace operations reference](/langsmith/organization-workspace-operations).\n\nNote the following details on custom roles:\n\n* Custom roles can only be created and managed by Organization Admins.\n* Custom roles are organization-specific (not transferable between organizations).\n* Each custom role can have any combination of workspace-level permissions.\n* Custom roles cannot have organization-level permissions.\n* Users can have different roles (including custom roles) in different workspaces.\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/rbac.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
