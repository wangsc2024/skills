This password may be changed later by any Organization Admin.\n* You cannot use both basic auth and OAuth with client secret at the same time.\n\n## Requirements and features\n\n* There is a single `Default` organization that is provisioned during initial installation, and creating additional organizations is not supported\n* Your initial password (configured below) must be least 12 characters long and have at least one lowercase, uppercase, and symbol\n* There are no strict requirements for the secret used for signing JWTs, but we recommend securely generating a string of at least 32 characters. For example: `openssl rand -base64 32`\n\n### Migrating from None auth\n\n**Only supported in versions 0.7 and above.**\n\nMigrating an installation from [None](/langsmith/authentication-methods#none) auth mode replaces the single \"default\" user with a user with the configured credentials and keeps all existing resources. The single pre-existing workspace ID post-migration remains `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`, but everything else about the migrated installation is standard for a basic auth installation.\n\nTo migrate, simply update your configuration as shown below and run `helm upgrade` (or `docker-compose up`) as usual.\n\n<Note>\n  Changing the JWT secret will log out your users\n</Note>\n\nAdditionally, in docker-compose you will need to run the bootstrap command to create the initial organization and user:\n\nOnce configured, you will see a login screen like the one below. You should be able to login with the `initialOrgAdminEmail` and `initialOrgAdminPassword` values, and your user will be auto-provisioned with role `Organization Admin`. See the [admin guide](/langsmith/administration-overview#organization-roles) for more details on organization roles.\n\n<img src=\"https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn/langsmith/images/langsmith-ui-basic-auth.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn&q=85&s=2f88a4bffacc308d7fbd22cba1f1c9f1\" alt=\"LangSmith UI with basic auth\" data-og-width=\"1424\" width=\"1424\" data-og-height=\"1156\" height=\"1156\" data-path=\"langsmith/images/langsmith-ui-basic-auth.png\" data-optimize=\"true\" data-opv=\"3\" srcset=\"https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn/langsmith/images/langsmith-ui-basic-auth.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn&q=85&s=1d0297842dd132b61fa295b52e93859e 280w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn/langsmith/images/langsmith-ui-basic-auth.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn&q=85&s=975b75e1f4262b5278e2d56896bec326 560w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn/langsmith/images/langsmith-ui-basic-auth.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn&q=85&s=54a1827e8611f72359a121dd209b5860 840w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn/langsmith/images/langsmith-ui-basic-auth.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn&q=85&s=42618816bdfbd171e32d064fd00652da 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn/langsmith/images/langsmith-ui-basic-auth.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn&q=85&s=a73742556b59333c002f9d0f5d314e6e 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn/langsmith/images/langsmith-ui-basic-auth.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn&q=85&s=93b93edf04b03f1ab652df38270364c2 2500w\" />\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/self-host-basic-auth.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
