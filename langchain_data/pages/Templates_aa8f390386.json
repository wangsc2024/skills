Templates include predefined system prompts, tools, and triggers (if applicable) for common use cases. You can use templates as-is, or as a baseline to customize.\n\n## How to use templates\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Pick a template\" icon=\"squares-plus\">\n    In Agent Builder, choose a template that matches your use case (e.g., Gmail assistant, Linear Slack bot, etc.).\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Review tools and prompts\" icon=\"sliders\">\n    Each template comes with an initial system prompt and a set of tools. Review the tools and prompt to ensure they align with your needs (you can always edit them later, or have the agent edit it for you).\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Clone and authenticate\" icon=\"key\">\n    Click `Clone Template` in the top right to start the cloning process. If you haven't already authenticated with OAuth for the tools in the template, you'll be prompted to do so.\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Add triggers (optional)\" icon=\"clock\">\n    If a template includes a trigger, you'll be prompted to:\n\n* Authenticate and setup the trigger if you haven't done this before\n      or\n    * Select an existing trigger from the dropdown list\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Test and iterate\" icon=\"rocket\">\n    Run the agent, review outputs, and refine prompts or tools. To edit your cloned agent, either make the changes manually, or ask the agent to make the changes for you!\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n<Note icon=\"sliders\" color=\"#E9D5FF\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  Templates are starting points. You can customize prompts, add or remove tools, attach triggers, and switch models at any time.\n</Note>\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/agent-builder-templates.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
