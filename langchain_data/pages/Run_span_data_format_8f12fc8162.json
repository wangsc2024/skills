The **bolded** fields are the most important ones to know about.\n\n| Field Name                    | Type             | Description                                                                                                                   |\n| ----------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **id**                        | UUID             | Unique identifier for the span.                                                                                               |\n| **name**                      | string           | The name associated with the run.                                                                                             |\n| **inputs**                    | object           | A map or set of inputs provided to the run.                                                                                   |\n| **run\\_type**                 | string           | Type of run, e.g., \"llm\", \"chain\", \"tool\".                                                                                    |\n| **start\\_time**               | datetime         | Start time of the run.                                                                                                        |\n| **end\\_time**                 | datetime         | End time of the run.                                                                                                          |\n| **extra**                     | object           | Any extra information run.                                                                                                    |\n| **error**                     | string           | Error message if the run encountered an error.                                                                                |\n| **outputs**                   | object           | A map or set of outputs generated by the run.                                                                                 |\n| **events**                    | array of objects | A list of event objects associated with the run.
