  "content": "Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/self-host-playground-environment-settings\n\n<Note>\n  This feature is only available on Helm chart versions 0.10.27 (application version 0.10.74) and later.\n</Note>\n\nMany model providers support setting credentials and other configuration options through environment variables. This is useful for self-hosted deployments where you want to avoid hardcoding sensitive information in your code or configuration files. In LangSmith, most model interactions are done through the `playground` service, which allows you to configure many of those environment variables directly on the pod itself. This can be useful to avoid having to set credentials in the UI.\n\n* A self-hosted LangSmith instance with the `playground` service running.\n* The provider you want to configure must support environment variables for configuration. Check the provider's Chat Model [documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/) for more information.\n* The secrets/roles you may want to attach to the `playground` service.\n  * Note that for IRSA you may need to grant the `langsmith-playground` service account the necessary permissions to access the secrets or roles in your cloud provider.\n\nWith the parameters from above, you can configure your LangSmith instance to use environment variables for model providers. You can do this by modifying the `langsmith_config.yaml` file for your LangSmith Helm Chart installation or the `docker-compose.yaml` file for your Docker installation.\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/self-host-playground-environment-settings.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
