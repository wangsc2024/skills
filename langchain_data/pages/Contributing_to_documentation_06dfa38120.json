  "content": "Source: https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/contributing/documentation\n\nAccessible documentation is a vital part of LangChain. We welcome both documentation for new features and [integrations](/oss/python/contributing/publish-langchain#adding-documentation), as well as community improvements to existing docs.\n\n<Note>\n  These are contribution guidelines for our open source projects, but they also apply to the [LangSmith documentation](/langsmith/home).\n</Note>\n\nFor quick changes like fixing typos or changing a link, you can edit directly on GitHub without setting up a local development environment:\n\n<Info>\n  **Prerequisites:**\n\n* A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account\n  * Basic familiarity of the [fork-and-pull workflow](https://graphite.dev/guides/understanding-git-fork-pull-request-workflow) for contributing\n</Info>\n\n1. At the bottom of the page you want to edit, click the link **Edit this page on GitHub**.\n2. GitHub will prompt you to fork the repository to your account. Make sure to fork into your <Tooltip tip=\"If you clone to an organization, maintainers are unable to make edits, which may delay acceptance.\">personal account</Tooltip>.\n3. Make the changes directly in GitHub's web editor.\n4. Click **Commit changes...** and give your commit a descriptive title like `fix(docs): summary of change`. If applicable, add an [extended description](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/best-practices/git-commit-message#git-commit-message-structure).\n5. GitHub will redirect you to create a pull request. Give it a title (often the same as the commit) and follow the PR template checklist.\n\n<Note>\n  Docs PRs are typically reviewed within a few days. Keep an eye on your PR to address any feedback from maintainers.\n\nDo not bump the PR unless you have new information to provide – maintainers will address it as their availability permits.\n</Note>\n\n### Larger edits and additions\n\nFor larger changes, additions, or ongoing contributions, it's necessary to set up a local development environment on your machine. Our documentation build pipeline offers local preview, important for ensuring your changes appear as intended before submitting.\n\n#### Set up local environment\n\nBefore you can work on this project, ensure you have the following installed:\n\n* `python >= 3.13, < 4.0`\n* [**`uv`**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) - Python package manager (used for dependency management)\n* [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en) and [**`npm`**](https://www.npmjs.com/) - For Mintlify CLI and reference documentation builds\n* [**Make**](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) - For running build commands\n* [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) - For version control\n\n**Optional but recommended:**\n\n* **[`markdownlint-cli`](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli)** - For linting markdown files\n\n* **[`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/)** - Required only if you're working on reference documentation\n\n* **[Mintlify MDX VSCode extension](https://www.mintlify.com/blog/mdx-vscode-extension)**\n\n1. Clone the [`langchain-ai/docs`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs) repo. Follow the steps outlined in [`IDE_SETUP.md`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/blob/main/IDE_SETUP.md).\n\n2. Install dependencies:\n\n* Install Python dependencies using `uv sync --all-groups`\n   * Install Mintlify CLI globally via npm\n\n3. Verify your setup:\n\nThis should build the documentation without errors.\n\nAfter install, you'll have access to the `docs` command:\n\n* `docs dev` - Start development mode with file watching and hot reload\n* `docs build` - Build documentation\n\nSee [Available commands](#available-commands) for more details.\n\n#### Edit documentation\n\n<Note>\n  **Only edit files in `src/`** – The `build/` directory is automatically generated.\n</Note>\n\n1. Ensure your [environment is set up](#set-up-local-environment) and that you have followed the steps in [`IDE_SETUP.md`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/blob/main/IDE_SETUP.md) to configure your IDE/editor to automatically apply the correct settings.\n\n2. Edit files in `src/`\n   * Make changes to markdown files and the build system will automatically detect changes and rebuild affected files.\n   * If OSS content varies between Python and JavaScript/TypeScript, add content for [both in the same file](#co-locate-python-and-javascripttypescript-oss-content). Otherwise, content will be identical for both languages.\n   * Use [Mintlify syntax](https://mintlify.com/docs) for formatting.\n\n3. Start development mode to preview changes locally:\n\nThis starts a development server with hot reload at `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n* Continue editing and see changes reflected immediately.\n   * The development server rebuilds only changed files for faster feedback.\n\n5. Run the [quality checks](#run-quality-checks) to ensure your changes are valid.\n\n6. Get approval from the relevant reviewers.\n\nLangChain team members can [generate a sharable preview build](#create-a-sharable-preview-build)\n\n7. [Publish to production](#publish-to-prod) (team members only).\n\n#### Create a sharable preview build\n\n<Note>\n  Only LangChain team members can create sharable preview builds.\n</Note>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Instructions\">\n  Previews are useful for sharing work-in-progress changes with others.\n\nWhen you create or update a PR, a [preview branch/ID](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/actions/workflows/create-preview-branch.yml) is automatically generated for you. A comment will be left on the PR with the ID, which you can then use to generate a preview. (You can also run this workflow manually if needed.)\n\n1. Copy the preview branch's ID from the comment.\n  2. In the [Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/langchain-5e9cc07a?section=previews), click **Create preview deployment**.\n  3. Enter the preview branch's ID.\n  4. Click **Create deployment**.\n     A **Manual update** will display in the **Previews** table.\n  5. Select the preview and click **Visit** to view the preview build.\n\nTo redeploy the preview build with the latest changes, click **Redeploy** on the Mintlify dashboard.\n</Accordion>\n\n#### Run quality checks\n\nBefore submitting changes, ensure your code passes formatting and linting checks:\n\n```bash  theme={null}",
