  "content": "Source: https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/providers/aws\n\nThis page covers all LangChain integrations with the [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) platform.\n\n> [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) is a fully managed service that offers a choice of\n> high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies like `AI21 Labs`, `Anthropic`, `Cohere`,\n> `Meta`, `Stability AI`, and `Amazon` via a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to\n> build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Using `Amazon Bedrock`,\n> you can easily experiment with and evaluate top FMs for your use case, privately customize them with\n> your data using techniques such as fine-tuning and `Retrieval Augmented Generation` (`RAG`), and build\n> agents that execute tasks using your enterprise systems and data sources. Since `Amazon Bedrock` is\n> serverless, you don't have to manage any infrastructure, and you can securely integrate and deploy\n> generative AI capabilities into your applications using the AWS services you are already familiar with.\n\nSee a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/chat/bedrock).\n\nAWS Bedrock maintains a [Converse API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.html)\nthat provides a unified conversational interface for Bedrock models. This API does not\nyet support custom models. You can see a list of all\n[models that are supported here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference.html).\n\n<Info>\n  **We recommend the Converse API for users who do not need to use custom models. It can be accessed using [ChatBedrockConverse](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/aws/chat_models/langchain_aws.chat_models.bedrock_converse.ChatBedrockConverse.html).**\n</Info>\n\nSee a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/chat/bedrock).\n\nSee a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/llms/bedrock).\n\n### Amazon API Gateway\n\n> [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) is a fully managed service that makes it easy for\n> developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.
