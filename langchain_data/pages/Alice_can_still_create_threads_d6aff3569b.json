You've built a chatbot where each user has their own private conversations. While this system uses simple token-based authentication, these authorization patterns will work with implementing any real authentication system. In the next tutorial, you'll replace your test users with real user accounts using OAuth2.\n\nNow that you can control access to resources, you might want to:\n\n1. Move on to [Connect an authentication provider](/langsmith/add-auth-server) to add real user accounts.\n2. Read more about [authorization patterns](/langsmith/auth#authorization).\n3. Check out the [API reference](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langsmith/deployment/sdk/#langgraph_sdk.auth.Auth) for details about the interfaces and methods used in this tutorial.\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/resource-auth.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
