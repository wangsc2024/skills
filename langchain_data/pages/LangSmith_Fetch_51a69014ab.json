  "content": "Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/langsmith-fetch\n\nLangSmith Fetch is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for retrieving trace data ([runs](/langsmith/observability-concepts#runs), [traces](/langsmith/observability-concepts#traces), and [threads](/langsmith/observability-concepts#threads)) from your LangSmith projects. It allows you to use LangSmith’s tracing and debugging features directly in your terminal and development workflows.\n\nYou can use LangSmith Fetch for the following use cases:\n\n* Immediate debugging: Fetch the most recent trace of a failed or unexpected agent run with a single command.\n* Bulk export for analysis: Export large numbers of traces or entire conversation threads to JSON files for offline analysis, building [evaluation](/langsmith/evaluation-concepts) datasets, or [regression tests](/langsmith/evaluation-types#regression-tests).\n* Terminal-based workflows: Integrate trace data into your existing tools; for example, piping output to Unix utilities like jq, or feeding traces into an AI coding assistant for automated analysis.\n\nSet your [LangSmith API key](/langsmith/create-account-api-key) and project name:\n\nThe CLI will automatically fetch traces or threads in `LANGSMITH_PROJECT`. Replace `your-project-name` with the name of your LangSmith project (if it doesn't exist, it will be created automatically on first use).\n\n<Note>\n  `langsmith-fetch` only requires the `LANGSMITH_PROJECT` environment variable. It automatically looks up the project UUID and saves both to `~/.langsmith-cli/config.yaml`. You can also specify [a project by its UUID](#override-the-configured-tracing-project) via a CLI flag.\n</Note>\n\n### Use with a coding agent\n\nAfter you've installed and set up `langsmith-fetch`, use your coding agent to ask questions like the following:\n\nMany agents will use the `langsmith-fetch --help` command to understand how to use the CLI and complete your request.\n\n## Find project and trace IDs\n\nIn most cases, you won’t need to find IDs manually (the CLI uses your project name and latest traces by default). However, if you want to fetch a specific item by ID, you can find them in the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com):\n\n* **Project UUID**: Each project has a unique ID (UUID). You can find it in the project's URL or by hovering over <Icon icon=\"link-simple\" /> **ID** next to the project's name. This UUID can be used with the `--project-uuid` flag on CLI commands\n* **Trace ID**: Every trace (single execution) has an ID. In the **Runs** view, click on a specific run to see its Trace ID (copyable from the trace details panel). You can use `langsmith-fetch trace <trace-id>` to retrieve that exact trace if you have the ID.\n\nAfter installation and setup, you can use the `langsmith-fetch` command to retrieve traces or threads. The general usage is:\n\nLangSmith Fetch provides the following commands to fetch either single items or in bulk:\n\n| Command               | Fetches                                    | Output location                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `trace <id>`          | A specific trace by ID                     | Prints to stdout (or to a file with `--file`)                                                                                                                                           |\n| `thread <id>`         | A specific thread by ID                    | Prints to stdout (or to a file with `--file`)                                                                                                                                           |\n| `traces [directory]`  | Recent traces from the project (multiple)  | Saves each trace as a JSON file in the given directory, or prints to stdout if no directory is provided. **Tip:** Using a directory is recommended for [bulk exports](#fetch-multiple). |\n| `threads [directory]` | Recent threads from the project (multiple) | Saves each thread as a JSON file in the given directory, or prints to stdout if no directory is provided.                                                                               |\n\n<Note>\n  Traces are fetched chronologically with most recent first.\n</Note>\n\nThe commands support additional flags to filter and format the output:\n\n| Option / Flag               | Applies to                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                   | Default                                 |\n| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| `-n, --limit <int>`         | `traces`, `threads`              | Maximum number of traces/threads to fetch.

Provide an ISO 8601 timestamp (e.g.,`2025-12-01T00:00:00Z`) to get data after that time.                                              | *(no time filter)*                      |\n| `--project-uuid <uuid>`     | `trace, thread, traces, threads` | Manually specify the project by UUID (overrides the `LANGSMITH_PROJECT` env setting). Use this if you want to fetch from a different project without changing your env var.   | From env/config                         |\n| `--filename-pattern <text>` | `traces`, `threads`              | Pattern for output filenames when saving multiple files. You can use placeholders like `{trace_id}`, `{thread_id}`, `{index}`.                                                | `{trace_id}.json` or `{thread_id}.json` |\n| `--format <type>`           | **All commands**                 | Output format: `pretty`, `json`, or `raw`. (Refer to [Output formats](#output-formats) for details.)                                                                          | `pretty`                                |\n| `--file <path>`             | `trace`, `thread`                | Save the fetched trace/thread to a file instead of printing it.                                                                                                               | *(stdout)*                              |\n| `--include-metadata`        | `traces` (bulk fetch)            | Include run metadata in the output (such as tokens used, execution time, status, costs).

Enabling this will make an extra API call for each trace to fetch feedback data.                                           | *Off by default*                        |\n| `--max-concurrent <int>`    | `traces`, `threads`              | Maximum concurrent fetch requests. Tune this if you are fetching a large number of items; increasing it may speed up retrieval but 5–10 is recommended to avoid API overload. | **5**                                   |\n| `--no-progress`             | `traces`, `threads`              | Disable the progress bar output. By default a progress indicator is shown when fetching multiple items; use this flag to hide it (useful for non-interactive scripts).        | Progress bar on                         |\n\nThe `--format` option controls how the fetched data is displayed:\n\n* `pretty` (default): A human-readable view with rich text formatting for easy inspection in the terminal. This format is great for quick debugging of a single trace or thread.\n\nExplicitly specify the format:\n\n* `json`: Well-formatted JSON output with syntax highlighting. Use this if you want to examine the raw data structure or pipe it into JSON processing tools.\n\n* `raw`: Compact JSON with no extra whitespace. This is useful for piping the output to other programs (e.g., using `jq` or saving directly) without extra formatting.\n\n### Fetch a trace or thread\n\nYou can fetch a single thread or trace with the ID. The command will output to the terminal by default:\n\n<img src=\"https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/NS5dAlKHYqJeZH1b/langsmith/images/langsmith-fetch-output-single.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=NS5dAlKHYqJeZH1b&q=85&s=169393d4790449b3fd718e027c7f17d1\" alt=\"Output from a single trace fetch in default pretty format\" data-og-width=\"3090\" width=\"3090\" data-og-height=\"356\" height=\"356\" data-path=\"langsmith/images/langsmith-fetch-output-single.png\" data-optimize=\"true\" data-opv=\"3\" srcset=\"https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/NS5dAlKHYqJeZH1b/langsmith/images/langsmith-fetch-output-single.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=NS5dAlKHYqJeZH1b&q=85&s=e217554b2c5fe84d91949cb5831424d5 280w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/NS5dAlKHYqJeZH1b/langsmith/images/langsmith-fetch-output-single.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=NS5dAlKHYqJeZH1b&q=85&s=d5af45552d6ea96521707974fab82247 560w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/NS5dAlKHYqJeZH1b/langsmith/images/langsmith-fetch-output-single.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=NS5dAlKHYqJeZH1b&q=85&s=cb4e434511324385baf83786ce9d03fa 840w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/NS5dAlKHYqJeZH1b/langsmith/images/langsmith-fetch-output-single.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=NS5dAlKHYqJeZH1b&q=85&s=52b86ae2c326d9bb7728b2df4c0eb2ae 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/NS5dAlKHYqJeZH1b/langsmith/images/langsmith-fetch-output-single.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=NS5dAlKHYqJeZH1b&q=85&s=c154515ff66d11039531d65218ca1b51 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/NS5dAlKHYqJeZH1b/langsmith/images/langsmith-fetch-output-single.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=NS5dAlKHYqJeZH1b&q=85&s=69b91328f82da1dbd8283716532fc2f2 2500w\" />\n\nYou can optionally redirect the thread or trace data to a file using the `--file` option.\n\n<Note>\n  For bulk fetches of traces or threads, we recommend specifying a target directory path. Each fetched trace or thread will be saved as a separate JSON file in that folder, making it easy to browse or process them later.\n</Note>\n\nYou can specify a destination directory for the bulk commands (`traces`/`threads`). For example, the following command will save the 10 most recent traces as JSON files in the `my-traces-data` directory:\n\nIf you omit the directory and `--limit`, the tool will output the results of the most recent, single trace to your terminal.\n\nWhen sending to a directory, files will be named in the following way:\n\n* Default: Files named by trace ID (e.g., `3b0b15fe-1e3a-4aef-afa8-48df15879cfe.json`).\n* Custom pattern: Use `--filename-pattern` with placeholders:\n  * `{trace_id}`: Trace ID (default: `{trace_id}.json`).\n  * `{index}` or `{idx}`: Sequential number starting from 1.\n  * Format specs supported: `{index:03d}` for zero-padded numbers.\n\n### Include metadata and feedback\n\nYou can include [run metadata](/langsmith/observability-concepts#metadata) and any [feedback](/langsmith/observability-concepts#feedback) associated with the trace:\n\n### Override the configured tracing project\n\nTo fetch traces from a different project than the one configured with `LANGSMITH_PROJECT`, use the `--project-uuid` option:\n\nRunning this command will just fetch traces from that project, it will not modify the LangSmith project already configured in `~/.langsmith-cli/config.yaml`.\n\nYou can fetch traces or full threads and export to a file:\n\nThis command retrieves all threads that have occurred since December 1, 2025, saving each conversation as a JSON file under `./my_threads`. This is useful for exporting chat transcripts or building regression tests on multi-turn conversations. You could also use `--limit` with threads to fetch a specific number of recent threads, and `--last-n-minutes` works here as well.\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/langsmith-fetch.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
