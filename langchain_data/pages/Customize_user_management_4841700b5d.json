For self-hosted customers that would like to delegate this responsibility to workspace Admins, a feature flag may be set that enables workspace Admins to invite new users to the organization as well as their specific workspace **at the workspace level**.\n\nOnce this feature is enabled via the configuration option below, workspace Admins may add new users in the `Workspace members` tab under `Settings` > `Workspaces`. Both of the following cases are supported when inviting at the workspace level, while the organization level invite functions the same as before.\n\n1. Invite users who are NOT already active in the organization: this will add the users as pending to the organization and specific workspace\n2. Invite users who ARE already active in the organization: adds the users directly to the workspace as an active member (no pending state).\n\nAdmins may invite users for both cases at the same time.\n\n### SSO New Member Login Flow\n\nAs of helm **v0.11.10**, self-hosted deployments using OAuth SSO will no longer need to manually add members in LangSmith settings for them to join. Deployments will have a <b>default</b> organization, to which new users will automatically be added upon their first login to LangSmith.\n\nFor your **default** organization, you can set which workspace(s) and workspace role is assigned to new members. For **non-default** organizations, the invitation flow remains the same.\nOnce a user joins an organization, any changes to their workspaces or roles beyond the default organization settings must be managed either through LangSmith settings (as before) or via SCIM.\n\n<Note>\n  By default, all new users are added to the organization’s initially provisioned workspace (**Workspace 1** by default) with the **Workspace Editor** role.\n</Note>\n\n<img src=\"https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/QEp_iTXiY5U9rQvE/langsmith/images/sso-member-settings-update.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=QEp_iTXiY5U9rQvE&q=85&s=e7274ed7fdd47fe7c4c1f514d78f3ac7\" alt=\"Update SSO Member Settings\" data-og-width=\"1769\" width=\"1769\" data-og-height=\"1251\" height=\"1251\" data-path=\"langsmith/images/sso-member-settings-update.png\" data-optimize=\"true\" data-opv=\"3\" srcset=\"https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/QEp_iTXiY5U9rQvE/langsmith/images/sso-member-settings-update.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=QEp_iTXiY5U9rQvE&q=85&s=2acde74eb4c622771decfe6d750f7c35 280w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/QEp_iTXiY5U9rQvE/langsmith/images/sso-member-settings-update.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=QEp_iTXiY5U9rQvE&q=85&s=47bcef317de7189eda2743a66ead2070 560w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/QEp_iTXiY5U9rQvE/langsmith/images/sso-member-settings-update.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=QEp_iTXiY5U9rQvE&q=85&s=eaeb449a5dc84d481fee92b7bdd0e163 840w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/QEp_iTXiY5U9rQvE/langsmith/images/sso-member-settings-update.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=QEp_iTXiY5U9rQvE&q=85&s=dd18c7a8aa8ee1fc2cce7d418334c713 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/QEp_iTXiY5U9rQvE/langsmith/images/sso-member-settings-update.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=QEp_iTXiY5U9rQvE&q=85&s=a7d778198cdb93c3813b92341fc08b70 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/QEp_iTXiY5U9rQvE/langsmith/images/sso-member-settings-update.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=QEp_iTXiY5U9rQvE&q=85&s=6029314be79253612b1465581144b170 2500w\" />\n\n<Note>\n  To change your default organization, use **Set Default Organization** in the organization selector dropdown. (Org Admin permissions required in both the source and target organization.)\n</Note>\n\n### Disabling Organization Creating\n\nBy default, any user can create an organization in LangSmith. For self-hosted customers, an admin may want to restrict this ability after setting up initial organizations. This feature flag allows an admin to disable the ability for users to create new organizations.\n\n<Note>\n  The `userOrgCreationDisabled` feature flag is set to `true` by default for organizations using [basic auth](/langsmith/self-host-basic-auth) or [SSO](/langsmith/self-host-sso).\n</Note>\n\n### Disabling Personal Organizations\n\nBy default, any user who logs in to LangSmith will have a personal organization created for them. For self-hosted customers, an admin may want to restrict this ability. This feature flag allows an admin to disable the ability for users to create personal organizations.\n\n<Note>\n  The `personalOrgsDisabled` feature flag is set to `true` by default for organizations using [basic auth](/langsmith/self-host-basic-auth) or [SSO](/langsmith/self-host-sso).\n</Note>\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/self-host-user-management.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
