You make LangSmith aware of this by providing a path to the app in your `langgraph.json` configuration file.\n\nDefining a custom app object lets you add any routes you'd like, so you can do anything from adding a `/login` endpoint to writing an entire full-stack web-app, all deployed in a single Agent Server.\n\nBelow is an example using FastAPI.\n\nStarting from an **existing** LangSmith application, add the following custom route code to your `webapp.py` file. If you are starting from scratch, you can create a new app from a template using the CLI.\n\nOnce you have a LangGraph project, add the following app code:\n\n```python {highlight={4}} theme={null}",
