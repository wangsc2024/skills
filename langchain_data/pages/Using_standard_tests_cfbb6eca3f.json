LangChain provides a comprehensive [set of tests](https://pypi.org/project/langchain-tests/) for each integration type for you. This guide will show you how to add LangChain's standard test suite to each integration type.\n\nFirst, install the required dependencies:\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"langchain-core\" icon=\"cube\" href=\"https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/master/libs/core#readme\" arrow>\n    Defines the interfaces we want to import to define our custom components\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"langchain-tests\" icon=\"flask\" href=\"https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/master/libs/standard-tests#readme\" arrow>\n    Provides the standard tests and `pytest` plugins necessary to run them\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n\n<Warning>\n  Because added tests in new versions of `langchain-tests` can break your CI/CD pipelines, we recommend pinning to the latest version of [`langchain-tests`](https://pypi.org/project/langchain-tests/#history) to avoid unexpected changes.\n</Warning>\n\nThere are 2 namespaces in the `langchain-tests` package:\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Unit tests\" icon=\"gear\">\n    **Location**: `langchain_tests.unit_tests`\n\nDesigned to test the component in isolation and without access to external services\n\n[View API reference](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_tests/unit_tests)\n  </Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Integration tests\" icon=\"network-wired\">\n    **Location**: `langchain_tests.integration_tests`\n\nDesigned to test the component with access to external services (in particular, the external service that the component is designed to interact with)\n\n[View API reference](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_tests/integration_tests)\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n\nBoth types of tests are implemented as [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) class-based test suites.\n\n## Implementing standard tests\n\nDepending on your integration type, you will need to implement either or both unit and integration tests.\n\nBy subclassing the standard test suite for your integration type, you get the full collection of standard tests for that type. For a test run to be successful, the a given test should pass only if the model supports the capability being tested. Otherwise, the test should be skipped.\n\nBecause different integrations offer unique sets of features, most standard tests provided by LangChain are **opt-in by default** to prevent false positives. Consequently, you will need to override properties to indicate which features your integration supports - see the below example for an illustration.\n\n```python tests/integration_tests/test_standard.py theme={null}",
