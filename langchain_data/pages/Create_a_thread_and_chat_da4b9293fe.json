Without a valid token, we can't access the bot\n2. With a valid token, we can create threads and chat\n\nCongratulations! You've built a chatbot that only lets \"authenticated\" users access it. While this system doesn't (yet) implement a production-ready security scheme, we've learned the basic mechanics of how to control access to our bot. In the next tutorial, we'll learn how to give each user their own private conversations.\n\nNow that you can control who accesses your bot, you might want to:\n\n1.
