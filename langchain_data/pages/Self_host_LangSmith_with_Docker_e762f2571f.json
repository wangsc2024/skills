  "title": "Self-host LangSmith with Docker",
  "content": "Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/docker\n\n<Info>\n  Self-hosting LangSmith is an add-on to the Enterprise Plan designed for our largest, most security-conscious customers. See our [pricing page](https://www.langchain.com/pricing) for more detail, and [contact our sales team](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales) if you want to get a license key to trial LangSmith in your environment.\n</Info>\n\nThis guide provides instructions for running the **LangSmith platform** locally using Docker for development and testing purposes.\n\n<Warning>\n  **For development/testing only**. Do not use Docker Compose for production. For production deployments, use [Kubernetes](/langsmith/kubernetes).\n</Warning>\n\n<Note>\n  This page describes how to install the base [LangSmith platform](/langsmith/self-hosted#langsmith) for local testing. It does **not** include deployment management features. For more details, review the [self-hosted options](/langsmith/self-hosted).\n</Note>\n\nNote that Docker Compose is limited to local development environments only and does not extend support to container services such as AWS Elastic Container Service, Azure Container Instances, and Google Cloud Run.\n\n1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system. You can verify this by running:\n\nIf you don't see any server information in the output, make sure Docker is installed correctly and launch the Docker daemon.\n\n1. Recommended: At least 4 vCPUs, 16GB Memory available on your machine.\n      * You may need to tune resource requests/limits for all of our different services based off of organization size/usage\n   2. Disk Space: LangSmith can potentially require a lot of disk space. Ensure you have enough disk space available.\n\n2. LangSmith License Key\n   1. You can get this from your LangChain representative. [Contact our sales team](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales) for more information.\n\n1. This is a secret key that you can generate. It should be a random string of characters.\n   2. You can generate this using the following command:\n\n4. Egress to `https://beacon.langchain.com` (if not running in offline mode)\n   1. LangSmith requires egress to `https://beacon.langchain.com` for license verification and usage reporting. This is required for LangSmith to function properly. You can find more information on egress requirements in the [Egress](/langsmith/self-host-egress) section.\n\n5. Configuration\n   1. There are several configuration options that you can set in the `.env` file. You can find more information on the available configuration options in the [Configuration](/langsmith/self-host-scale) section.\n\n## Running via Docker Compose\n\nThe following explains how to run the LangSmith using Docker Compose. This is the most flexible way to run LangSmith without Kubernetes. The default configuration for Docker Compose is intended for local testing only and not for instances where any services are exposed to the public internet. **In production, we highly recommend using a secured Kubernetes environment.**\n\n### 1. Fetch the LangSmith `docker-compose.yml` file\n\nYou can find the `docker-compose.yml` file and related files in the LangSmith SDK repository here: [*LangSmith Docker Compose File*](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml)\n\nCopy the `docker-compose.yml` file and all files in that directory from the LangSmith SDK to your project directory.\n\n* Ensure that you copy the `users.xml` file as well.\n\n### 2. Configure environment variables\n\n1. Copy the `.env.example` file from the LangSmith SDK to your project directory and rename it to `.env`.\n2. Configure the appropriate values in the `.env` file. You can find the available configuration options in the [Configuration](/langsmith/self-hosted) section.\n\nYou can also set these environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file directly or export them in your terminal. We recommend setting them in the `.env` file.\n\nStart the LangSmith application by executing the following command in your terminal:\n\nYou can also run the server in the background by running:\n\n### Validate your deployment:\n\n1. Curl the exposed port of the `cli-langchain-frontend-1` container:\n\n2. Visit the exposed port of the `cli-langchain-frontend-1` container on your browser\n\nThe LangSmith UI should be visible/operational at `http://localhost:1980`\n\n<img src=\"https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn/langsmith/images/langsmith-ui.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn&q=85&s=5310f686e7b9eebaaee4fe2a152a8675\" alt=\".langsmith_ui.png\" data-og-width=\"2886\" width=\"2886\" data-og-height=\"1698\" height=\"1698\" data-path=\"langsmith/images/langsmith-ui.png\" data-optimize=\"true\" data-opv=\"3\" srcset=\"https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn/langsmith/images/langsmith-ui.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn&q=85&s=5f155ce778ca848f89fefff237b69bcb 280w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn/langsmith/images/langsmith-ui.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn&q=85&s=1d55d4068a9f53387c129b4688b0971e 560w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn/langsmith/images/langsmith-ui.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn&q=85&s=feb20198d67249ece559e5fd0e6d8e98 840w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn/langsmith/images/langsmith-ui.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn&q=85&s=3e5eba764d911e567d5aaa9e5702327b 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn/langsmith/images/langsmith-ui.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn&q=85&s=d45af56632578a8d1b05e546dfc8d01d 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn/langsmith/images/langsmith-ui.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=4kN8yiLrZX_amfFn&q=85&s=16a49517a6c224930fdb81c9ccde5527 2500w\" />\n\n### Checking the logs\n\nIf, at any point, you want to check if the server is running and see the logs, run\n\n### Stopping the server\n\nNow that LangSmith is running, you can start using it to trace your code. You can find more information on how to use self-hosted LangSmith in the [self-hosted usage guide](/langsmith/self-hosted).\n\nYour LangSmith instance is now running but may not be fully setup yet.\n\nIf you used one of the basic configs, you may have deployed a no-auth configuration. In this state, there is no authentication or concept of user accounts nor API keys and traces can be submitted directly without an API key so long as the hostname is passed to the LangChain tracer/LangSmith SDK.\n\nAs a next step, it is strongly recommended you work with your infrastructure administrators to:\n\n* Setup DNS for your LangSmith instance to enable easier access\n* Configure SSL to ensure in-transit encryption of traces submitted to LangSmith\n* Configure LangSmith for [oauth authentication](/langsmith/self-host-sso) or [basic authentication](/langsmith/self-host-basic-auth) to secure your LangSmith instance\n* Secure access to your Docker environment to limit access to only the LangSmith frontend and API\n* Connect LangSmith to secured Postgres and Redis instances\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/docker.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
