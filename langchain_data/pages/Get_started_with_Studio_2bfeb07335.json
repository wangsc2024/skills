To do so, navigate to the deployment in the UI and select **Studio**.\n\nThis will load Studio connected to your live deployment, allowing you to create, read, and update the [threads](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#threads), [assistants](/langsmith/assistants), and [memory](/oss/python/concepts/memory) in that deployment.\n\n## Local development server\n\nTo test your application locally using Studio:\n\n* Follow the [local application quickstart](/langsmith/local-server) first.\n* If you don't want data [traced](/langsmith/observability-concepts#traces) to LangSmith, set `LANGSMITH_TRACING=false` in your application's `.env` file. With tracing disabled, no data leaves your local server.\n\n1. Install the [LangGraph CLI](/langsmith/cli):\n\n<Warning>\n     **Browser Compatibility**\n     Safari blocks `localhost` connections to Studio. To work around this, run the command with `--tunnel` to access Studio via a secure tunnel.\n   </Warning>\n\nThis will start the Agent Server locally, running in-memory. The server will run in watch mode, listening for and automatically restarting on code changes. Read this [reference](/langsmith/cli#dev) to learn about all the options for starting the API server.\n\nYou will see the following logs:\n\nOnce running, you will automatically be directed to Studio.\n\n2. For a running server, access the Dbugger with one of the following:\n\n1. Directly navigate to the following URL: `https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024`.\n   2. Navigate to **Deployments** in the UI, click the **Studio** button on a deployment, enter `http://127.0.0.1:2024` and click **Connect**.\n\nIf running your server at a different host or port, update the `baseUrl` to match.\n\n### (Optional) Attach a debugger\n\nFor step-by-step debugging with breakpoints and variable inspection, run the following:\n\nThen attach your preferred debugger:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"VS Code\">\n    Add this configuration to `launch.json`:\n\n<Tab title=\"PyCharm\">\n    1. Go to Run → Edit Configurations\n    2. Click + and select \"Python Debug Server\"\n    3. Set IDE host name: `localhost`\n    4. Set port: `5678` (or the port number you chose in the previous step)\n    5. Click \"OK\" and start debugging\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n<Tip>\n  For issues getting started, refer to the [troubleshooting guide](/langsmith/troubleshooting-studio).\n</Tip>\n\nFor more information on how to run Studio, refer to the following guides:\n\n* [Run application](/langsmith/use-studio#run-application)\n* [Manage assistants](/langsmith/use-studio#manage-assistants)\n* [Manage threads](/langsmith/use-studio#manage-threads)\n* [Iterate on prompts](/langsmith/observability-studio)\n* [Debug LangSmith traces](/langsmith/observability-studio#debug-langsmith-traces)\n* [Add node to dataset](/langsmith/observability-studio#add-node-to-dataset)\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/quick-start-studio.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
