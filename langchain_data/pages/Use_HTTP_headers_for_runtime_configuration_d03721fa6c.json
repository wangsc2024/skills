  "content": "Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/configurable-headers\n\nLangGraph allows runtime configuration to modify agent behavior and permissions dynamically. When using [LangSmith Deployment](/langsmith/deployment-quickstart), you can pass this configuration in the request body (`config`) or specific request headers. This enables adjustments based on user identity or other requests.\n\nFor privacy, control which headers are passed to the runtime configuration via the `http.configurable_headers` section in your [`langgraph.json`](/langsmith/application-structure#configuration-file) file.\n\nHere's how to customize the included and excluded headers:\n\nThe `includes` and `excludes` lists accept exact header names or patterns using `*` to match any number of characters. For your security, no other regex patterns are supported.\n\n## Using within your graph\n\nYou can access the included headers in your graph using the `config` argument of any node.\n\nOr by fetching from context (useful in tools and or within other nested functions).\n\nYou can even use this to dynamically compile the graph.\n\n```python  theme={null}",
