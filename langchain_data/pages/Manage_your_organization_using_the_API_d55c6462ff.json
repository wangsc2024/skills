If the header is not present, operations will default to the workspace the API key was initially created in if it is not organization-scoped.\n\n**If `X-Tenant-Id` is not specified when accessing workspace-scoped resources with an organization-scoped API key, the request will fail with `403 Forbidden`.**\n</Warning>\n\nSome commonly-used endpoints and use cases are listed below. For a complete list of available endpoints, see the [API docs](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc). **The `X-Organization-Id` header should be present on all requests, and `X-Tenant-Id` header should be present on requests that are scoped to a particular workspace.**\n\n* [List workspaces](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/workspaces/operation/list_workspaces_api_v1_workspaces_get)\n* [Create workspace](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/workspaces/operation/create_workspace_api_v1_workspaces_post)\n* [Update workspace name](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/workspaces/operation/patch_workspace_api_v1_workspaces__workspace_id__patch)\n\n* [List roles](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/orgs/operation/list_organization_roles_api_v1_orgs_current_roles_get)\n* [List permissions](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/orgs/operation/update_organization_roles_api_v1_orgs_current_roles__role_id__patch)\n* [Create role](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/orgs/operation/create_organization_roles_api_v1_orgs_current_roles_post)\n* [Update role](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/orgs/operation/update_organization_roles_api_v1_orgs_current_roles__role_id__patch)\n\n### Membership management\n\n`List roles` under [RBAC](#rbac) should be used for retrieving role IDs of these operations. `List [organization|workspace] members` endpoints (below) response `\"id\"`s should be used as `identity_id` in these operations.\n\n* [List active organization members](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/orgs/operation/get_current_active_org_members_api_v1_orgs_current_members_active_get)\n* [List pending organization members](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/orgs/operation/get_current_pending_org_members_api_v1_orgs_current_members_pending_get)\n* [Invite a user to the organization and one or more workspaces](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/orgs/operation/add_members_to_current_org_batch_api_v1_orgs_current_members_batch_post). This should be used when the user is not already a member in the organization.\n* [Update a user's organization role](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/workspaces/operation/add_member_to_current_workspace_api_v1_workspaces_current_members_post)\n* [Remove someone from the organization](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/orgs/operation/remove_member_from_current_org_api_v1_orgs_current_members__identity_id__delete)\n\n* [List workspace members](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/workspaces/operation/get_current_workspace_members_api_v1_workspaces_current_members_get)\n* [Add a member to a workspace that is already part of the organization](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/workspaces/operation/add_member_to_current_workspace_api_v1_workspaces_current_members_post)\n* [Update a user's workspace role](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/workspaces/operation/add_member_to_current_workspace_api_v1_workspaces_current_members_post)\n* [Remove someone from a workspace](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/workspaces/operation/delete_current_workspace_member_api_v1_workspaces_current_members__identity_id__delete)\n\n<Note>\n  These params should be omitted: `read_only` (deprecated), `password` and `full_name` ([basic auth](/langsmith/authentication-methods) only)\n</Note>\n\n* [Create a service key](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/api-key/operation/generate_api_key_api_v1_api_key_post)\n* [Delete a service key](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/api-key/operation/delete_api_key_api_v1_api_key__api_key_id__delete)\n\n<Note>\n  Organization Admin permissions are required to make these changes.\n</Note>\n\n<Note>\n  \"Shared resources\" in this context refer to [public prompts](/langsmith/create-a-prompt#save-your-prompt), [shared runs](/langsmith/share-trace), and [shared datasets](/langsmith/manage-datasets#share-a-dataset).\n</Note>\n\n<Warning>\n  Updating these settings affects **all resources in the organization**.\n</Warning>\n\nYou can update these settings under the **Settings > Shared** tab for a workspace, or via API:\n\n* [Update organization sharing settings](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/orgs/operation/update_current_organization_info_api_v1_orgs_current_info_patch)\n  * use `unshare_all` to unshare **ALL** shared resources in the organization - use `disable_public_sharing` to prevent future sharing of resources\n\nThese settings are only editable via API:\n\n* [Disable/enable PAT creation](https://api.smith.langchain.com/redoc#tag/orgs/operation/update_current_organization_info_api_v1_orgs_current_info_patch) (for self-hosted, available in Helm chart version 0.11.25+)\n  * Use `pat_creation_disabled` to disable PAT creation for the entire organization.\n  * See the [admin guide](/langsmith/administration-overview#organization-roles) for information about the Organization Viewer role, which cannot create PATs.\n\n## User-only endpoints\n\nThese endpoints are user-scoped and require a logged-in user's JWT, so they should only be executed through the UI.\n\n* `/api-key/current` endpoints: these are related a user's PATs\n* `/sso/email-verification/send` (Cloud-only): this endpoint is related to [SAML SSO](/langsmith/user-management)\n\nThe sample code below goes through a few common workflows related to organization management. Make sure to make necessary replacements wherever `<replace_me>` is in the code.\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/manage-organization-by-api.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
