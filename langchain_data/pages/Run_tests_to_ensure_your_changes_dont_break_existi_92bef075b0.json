For example, `@[ChatAnthropic]` becomes a link to the Python or JS API reference page depending on which version of the docs is being built, **but only if an entry exists in the `link_map.py` file!** See below for details.\n\n<Accordion title=\"How autolinks work\">\n  The `@[]` syntax is processed by [`handle_auto_links.py`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/blob/main/pipeline/preprocessors/handle_auto_links.py). It looks up link keys in [`link_map.py`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/blob/main/pipeline/preprocessors/link_map.py), which contains dictionary mappings for both Python and JavaScript scopes.\n\n**Supported formats:**\n\n| Syntax                   | Result                                                                                     |\n  | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n  | `@[ChatAnthropic]`       | Link with \"ChatAnthropic\" as the displayed text                                            |\n  | ``@[`ChatAnthropic`]``   | Link with `` `ChatAnthropic` `` (code formatted) as text                                   |\n  | `@[text][ChatAnthropic]` | Link with \"text\" as text and `ChatAnthropic` as the key in the link map                    |\n  | `\\@[ChatAnthropic]`      | Escaped: renders as literal `@[ChatAnthropic]` (no link – what's being used on this page!) |\n\n**Adding new links:**\n\nIf a link isn't found in the map, it will be left unchanged in the output. To add a new autolink:\n\n1. Open `pipeline/preprocessors/link_map.py`\n  2. Add an entry to the appropriate scope (`python` or `js`) in `LINK_MAPS`\n  3. The key is the link name used in `@[key]` or `@[text][key]`, the value is the path relative to the reference host\n</Accordion>\n\n**From API reference stubs to OSS docs:**\n\nSee the [`README`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/blob/main/reference/python/README.md) for more information on linking from API reference stubs to Python OSS docs. Specifically see the `mkdocstrings` cross-reference [linking syntax](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/blob/main/reference/python/README.md#mkdocsmkdocstrings-python-cross-reference-linking-syntax).\n\nOur goal is to have the simplest developer setup possible. Should you experience any difficulty getting setup, please ask in the [community slack](https://www.langchain.com/join-community) or open a [forum post](https://forum.langchain.com/).

For more details, see the [co-locate Python and JavaScript/TypeScript content](#co-locate-python-and-javascripttypescript-content) section.\n</Note>\n\n### How-to guides\n\nHow-to guides are task-oriented instructions for users who know what they want to accomplish. Examples of how-to guides are on the [LangChain](/oss/python/langchain/overview) and [LangGraph](/oss/python/langgraph/overview) tabs.\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Characteristics\">\n    * **Task-focused**: Focus on a specific task or problem\n    * **Step-by-step**: Break down the task into smaller steps\n    * **Hands-on**: Provide concrete examples and code snippets\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Tips\">\n    * Focus on the **how** rather than the **why**\n    * Use concrete examples and code snippets\n    * Break down the task into smaller steps\n    * Link to related conceptual guides and references\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Examples\">\n    * [Messages](/oss/python/langchain/messages)\n    * [Tools](/oss/python/langchain/tools)\n    * [Streaming](/oss/python/langgraph/streaming)\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n\n### Conceptual guides\n\nConceptual guide cover core concepts abstractly, providing deep understanding.\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Characteristics\">\n    * **Understanding-focused**: Explain why things work as they do\n    * **Broad perspective**: Higher and wider view than other types\n    * **Design-oriented**: Explain decisions and trade-offs\n    * **Context-rich**: Use analogies and comparisons\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Tips\">\n    * Focus on the **\"why\"** rather than the \"how\"\n    * Provides supplementary information not necessarily required for feature usage\n    * Can use analogies and reference alternatives\n    * Avoid blending in too much reference content\n    * Link to related tutorials and how-to guides\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Examples\">\n    * [Memory](/oss/python/concepts/memory)\n    * [Context](/oss/python/concepts/context)\n    * [Graph API](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api)\n    * [Functional API](/oss/python/langgraph/functional-api)\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n\n### Reference\n\nReference documentation contains detailed, low-level information describing exactly what functionality exists and how to use it.\n\n<CardGroup cols={2}>\n  <Card title=\"Python reference\" href=\"https://reference.langchain.com/python/\" icon=\"python\" arrow />\n\n  <Card title=\"JavaScript/TypeScript reference\" href=\"https://reference.langchain.com/javascript/\" icon=\"js\" arrow />\n</CardGroup>\n\nA good reference should:\n\n* Describe what exists (all parameters, options, return values)\n* Be comprehensive and structured for easy lookup\n* Serve as the authoritative source for technical details\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Contributing to references\">\n    See the contributing guide for [Python reference docs](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/blob/main/reference/python/README.md).\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"LangChain reference best practices\">\n    * **Be consistent**; follow existing patterns for provider-specific documentation\n    * Include both basic usage (code snippets) and common edge cases/failure modes\n    * Note when features require specific versions\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"When to create new reference documentation\">\n    * New integrations or providers need dedicated reference pages\n    * Complex configuration options require detailed explanation\n    * API changes introduce new parameters or behavior\n    * Community frequently asks questions about specific functionality\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n\n### Tutorials\n\nTutorials are longer form step-by-step guides that builds upon itself and takes users through a specific practical activity to build understanding. Tutorials are typically found on the [Learn](/oss/python/learn) tab.\n\n<Note>\n  We generally do not merge new tutorials from outside contributors without an acute need.

Link to other sections frequently to allow users to learn about unfamiliar topics. This includes linking to API references and conceptual sections.\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Be concise\">\n    Take a less-is-more approach. If another section with a good explanation exists, link to it rather than re-explain, unless your content presents a new angle.\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n\n### Accessibility requirements\n\nEnsure documentation is accessible to all users:\n\n* Structure content for easy scanning with headers and lists\n* Use specific, actionable link text instead of \"click here\"\n* Include descriptive alt text for all images and diagrams\n\n### Cross-referencing\n\nUse consistent cross-references to connect docs with API reference documentation.\n\n**From docs to API reference:**\n\nUse the `@[]` syntax to link to API reference pages:",
