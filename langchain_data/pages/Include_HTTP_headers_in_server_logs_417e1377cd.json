  "content": "Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/configurable-logs\n\nBy default, the [Agent Server](/langsmith/agent-server) omits HTTP headers from server logs for privacy reasons. However, logging request and correlation IDs can help you debug issues and trace requests across distributed systems. You can opt-in to logging headers for all API calls by modifying the `logging_headers` section in your [`langgraph.json`](/langsmith/application-structure#configuration-file) file.\n\nThe `includes` and `excludes` lists accept exact header names or glob patterns using `*` as a wildcard to match any number of characters (case-insensitive). For your security, no other pattern types are supported.\n\nNote that exclusions take precedence over inclusions. For example, if you include `*-id` but exclude `x-user-id`, the `x-user-id` header will not be logged.\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/configurable-logs.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
