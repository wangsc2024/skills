Install the LangGraph CLI\n\n## 2. Create a LangGraph app\n\nCreate a new app from the [`new-langgraph-project-python` template](https://github.com/langchain-ai/new-langgraph-project). This template demonstrates a single-node application you can extend with your own logic.\n\n<Tip>\n  **Additional templates**\n  If you use `langgraph new` without specifying a template, you will be presented with an interactive menu that will allow you to choose from a list of available templates.\n</Tip>\n\n## 3. Install dependencies\n\nIn the root of your new LangGraph app, install the dependencies in `edit` mode so your local changes are used by the server:\n\n## 4. Create a `.env` file\n\nYou will find a `.env.example` in the root of your new LangGraph app. Create a `.env` file in the root of your new LangGraph app and copy the contents of the `.env.example` file into it, filling in the necessary API keys:\n\n## 5. Launch Agent server\n\nStart the LangGraph API server locally:\n\nThe `langgraph dev` command starts Agent Server in an in-memory mode. This mode is suitable for development and testing purposes. For production use, deploy Agent Server with access to a persistent storage backend. For more information, see the [Platform setup overview](/langsmith/platform-setup).\n\n## 6. Test your application in Studio\n\n[Studio](/langsmith/studio) is a specialized UI that you can connect to LangGraph API server to visualize, interact with, and debug your application locally. Test your graph in Studio by visiting the URL provided in the output of the `langgraph dev` command:\n\nFor an Agent Server running on a custom host/port, update the `baseUrl` query parameter in the URL. For example, if your server is running on `http://myhost:3000`:\n\n<Accordion title=\"Safari compatibility\">\n  Use the `--tunnel` flag with your command to create a secure tunnel, as Safari has limitations when connecting to localhost servers:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Python SDK (async)\">\n    1.
