With Cloud deployment, you can deploy directly from your GitHub repository—LangSmith handles the infrastructure, scaling, and operational concerns.\n\nTraditional hosting platforms are built for stateless, short-lived web applications. LangSmith Cloud is **purpose-built for stateful, long-running agents** that require persistent state and background execution.\n\n<Tip>\n  LangSmith offers multiple deployment options beyond Cloud, including deploying with a [control plane (hybrid/self-hosted)](/langsmith/deploy-with-control-plane) or as [standalone servers](/langsmith/deploy-standalone-server). For more information, refer to the [Deployment overview](/langsmith/deployments).\n</Tip>\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you have the following:\n\n* A [GitHub account](https://github.com/)\n* A [LangSmith account](https://smith.langchain.com/) (free to sign up)\n\n### 1. Create a repository on GitHub\n\nYour application's code must reside in a GitHub repository to be deployed on LangSmith. Both public and private repositories are supported. For this quickstart, first make sure your app is LangGraph-compatible by following the [local server setup guide](/oss/python/langgraph/studio#setup-local-agent-server). Then, push your code to the repository.\n\n### 2. Deploy to LangSmith\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Navigate to LangSmith Deployment\">\n    Log in to [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/). In the left sidebar, select **Deployments**.\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Create new deployment\">\n    Click the **+ New Deployment** button. A pane will open where you can fill in the required fields.\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Link repository\">\n    If you are a first time user or adding a private repository that has not been previously connected, click the **Add new account** button and follow the instructions to connect your GitHub account.\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Deploy repository\">\n    Select your application's repository. Click **Submit** to deploy. This may take about 15 minutes to complete. You can check the status in the **Deployment details** view.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### 3. Test your application in Studio\n\nOnce your application is deployed:\n\n1. Select the deployment you just created to view more details.\n2. Click the **Studio** button in the top right corner. Studio will open to display your graph.\n\n### 4. Get the API URL for your deployment\n\n1. In the **Deployment details** view in LangGraph, click the **API URL** to copy it to your clipboard.\n2. Click the `URL` to copy it to the clipboard.\n\nYou can now test the API:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Python\">\n    1. Install LangGraph Python:\n\n2.
