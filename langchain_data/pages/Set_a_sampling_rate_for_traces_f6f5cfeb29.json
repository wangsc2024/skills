Sampling rates allow you to control what percentage of traces are logged, helping you balance observability needs with cost considerations.\n\n## Set a global sampling rate\n\n<Note>\n  This section is relevant for those using the LangSmith SDK or LangChain, not for those logging directly with the LangSmith API.\n</Note>\n\nBy default, all traces are logged to LangSmith. To down-sample the number of traces logged to LangSmith, set the `LANGSMITH_TRACING_SAMPLING_RATE` environment variable to any float between `0` (no traces) and `1` (all traces). For instance, setting the following environment variable will log 75% of the traces.\n\nThis works for the `traceable` decorator and `RunTree` objects.\n\n## Set different sampling rates per client\n\nYou can also set sampling rates on specific `Client` instances and use the `tracing_context` context manager:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom langsmith import Client, tracing_context",
