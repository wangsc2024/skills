You can use all the same API methods as you would with any other LangGraph deployment.\n\nTo authenticate with the deployment your Agent Builder agents are running on, you must provide a personal access token (PAT) API key tied to your user to the `api_key` arg when instantiating the LangGraph SDK client, or via the `X-API-Key` header. Then, set the `X-Auth-Scheme` header to `langsmith-api-key`.\n\nIf the PAT you pass is not tied to the owner of the agent, your request will be rejected with a 404 not found error.\n\nIf the agent you're trying to invoke is a workspace agent, and you're not the owner, you'll be able to preform all the same operations as you would in the UI (read-only).\n\nTo invoke the agent, you can copy the code below, and replace the `agent_id` and `api_url` with the correct values.\n\nAlternatively, you can copy the same code shown below, but pre-populated with the proper agent ID and API URL, via the Agent Builder UI. To do this, navigate to the agent you want to invoke, visit the editor page, then click on the <Icon icon=\"gear\" /> settings icon in the top right corner, and click `View code snippets`. You'll still need to manually set your `LANGGRAPH_API_KEY` environment variable.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Python\">\n    \n  </Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"TypeScript\">\n    \n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n<Callout icon=\"key\" color=\"#FEF3C7\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  Use a PAT (Personal Access Token) API key tied to your user account. Set the `X-Auth-Scheme` header to `langsmith-api-key` for authentication. If you implemented custom authentication, pass your user's token in headers so the agent can use user‑scoped tools. See \"Add custom authentication\".\n</Callout>\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/agent-builder-code.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
