LangGraph provides several checkpointer implementations, all implemented via standalone, installable libraries:\n\n* `langgraph-checkpoint`: The base interface for checkpointer savers ([`BaseCheckpointSaver`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.base.BaseCheckpointSaver)) and serialization/deserialization interface ([`SerializerProtocol`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.serde.base.SerializerProtocol)). Includes in-memory checkpointer implementation ([`InMemorySaver`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.memory.InMemorySaver)) for experimentation. LangGraph comes with `langgraph-checkpoint` included.\n* `langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite`: An implementation of LangGraph checkpointer that uses SQLite database ([`SqliteSaver`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite.SqliteSaver) / [`AsyncSqliteSaver`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite.aio.AsyncSqliteSaver)). Ideal for experimentation and local workflows. Needs to be installed separately.\n* `langgraph-checkpoint-postgres`: An advanced checkpointer that uses Postgres database ([`PostgresSaver`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.postgres.PostgresSaver) / [`AsyncPostgresSaver`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.postgres.aio.AsyncPostgresSaver)), used in LangSmith. Ideal for using in production. Needs to be installed separately.\n\n### Checkpointer interface\n\nEach checkpointer conforms to [`BaseCheckpointSaver`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.base.BaseCheckpointSaver) interface and implements the following methods:\n\n* `.put` - Store a checkpoint with its configuration and metadata.\n* `.put_writes` - Store intermediate writes linked to a checkpoint (i.e. [pending writes](#pending-writes)).\n* `.get_tuple` - Fetch a checkpoint tuple using for a given configuration (`thread_id` and `checkpoint_id`). This is used to populate `StateSnapshot` in `graph.get_state()`.\n* `.list` - List checkpoints that match a given configuration and filter criteria. This is used to populate state history in `graph.get_state_history()`\n\nIf the checkpointer is used with asynchronous graph execution (i.e. executing the graph via `.ainvoke`, `.astream`, `.abatch`), asynchronous versions of the above methods will be used (`.aput`, `.aput_writes`, `.aget_tuple`, `.alist`).\n\n<Note>\n  For running your graph asynchronously, you can use [`InMemorySaver`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.memory.InMemorySaver), or async versions of Sqlite/Postgres checkpointers -- [`AsyncSqliteSaver`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite.aio.AsyncSqliteSaver) / [`AsyncPostgresSaver`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.postgres.aio.AsyncPostgresSaver) checkpointers.\n</Note>\n\n### Serializer\n\nWhen checkpointers save the graph state, they need to serialize the channel values in the state. This is done using serializer objects.\n\n`langgraph_checkpoint` defines [protocol](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.serde.base.SerializerProtocol) for implementing serializers provides a default implementation ([`JsonPlusSerializer`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.serde.jsonplus.JsonPlusSerializer)) that handles a wide variety of types, including LangChain and LangGraph primitives, datetimes, enums and more.\n\n#### Serialization with `pickle`\n\nThe default serializer, [`JsonPlusSerializer`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.serde.jsonplus.JsonPlusSerializer), uses ormsgpack and JSON under the hood, which is not suitable for all types of objects.\n\nIf you want to fallback to pickle for objects not currently supported by our msgpack encoder (such as Pandas dataframes),\nyou can use the `pickle_fallback` argument of the [`JsonPlusSerializer`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.serde.jsonplus.JsonPlusSerializer):",
