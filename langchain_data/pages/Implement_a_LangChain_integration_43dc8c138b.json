They implement one or more components that adhere to the LangChain interface standards.\n\nLangChain components are subclasses of base classes in [`langchain-core`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/master/libs/core). Examples include [chat models](/oss/python/integrations/chat), [tools](/oss/python/integrations/tools), [retrievers](/oss/python/integrations/retrievers), and more.\n\nYour integration package will typically implement a subclass of at least one of these components. Expand the tabs below to see details on each.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Chat Models\">\n    Chat models are subclasses of the [`BaseChatModel`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel) class. They implement methods for generating chat completions, handling message formatting, and managing model parameters.\n\n<Warning>\n      The chat model integration guide is currently WIP. In the meantime, read the [chat model conceptual guide](/oss/python/langchain/models) for details on how LangChain chat models function.\n    </Warning>\n  </Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"Tools\">\n    Tools are used in 2 main ways:\n\n1. To define an \"input schema\" or \"args schema\" to pass to a chat model's tool calling feature along with a text request, such that the chat model can generate a \"tool call\", or parameters to call the tool with.\n    2. To take a \"tool call\" as generated above, and take some action and return a response that can be passed back to the chat model as a ToolMessage.\n\nThe Tools class must inherit from the [`BaseTool`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/tools/#langchain.tools.BaseTool) base class. This interface has 3 properties and 2 methods that should be implemented in a subclass.\n\n<Warning>\n      The tools integration guide is currently WIP. In the meantime, read the [tools conceptual guide](/oss/python/langchain/tools) for details on how LangChain tools function.\n    </Warning>\n  </Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"Retrievers\">\n    Retrievers are used to retrieve documents from APIs, databases, or other sources based on a query. The Retriever class must inherit from the BaseRetriever base class.\n\n<Warning>\n      The retriever integration guide is currently WIP. In the meantime, read the [retriever conceptual guide](/oss/python/integrations/retrievers) for details on how LangChain retrievers function.\n    </Warning>\n  </Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"Vector Stores\">\n    All vector stores must inherit from the [`VectorStore`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/vectorstores/?h=#langchain_core.vectorstores.base.VectorStore) base class. This interface consists of methods for writing, deleting and searching for documents in the vector store.\n\nSee the [vector store integration guide](/oss/python/integrations/vectorstores) for details on implementing a vector store integration.\n\n<Warning>\n      The vector store integration guide is currently WIP. In the meantime, read the [vector store conceptual guide](/oss/python/integrations/vectorstores) for details on how LangChain vector stores function.\n    </Warning>\n  </Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"Embeddings\">\n    Embedding models are subclasses of the [`Embeddings`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/embeddings/#langchain_core.embeddings.embeddings.Embeddings) class.\n\n<Warning>\n      The embedding model integration guide is currently WIP. In the meantime, read the [embedding model conceptual guide](/oss/python/integrations/text_embedding) for details on how LangChain embedding models function.\n    </Warning>\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/oss/contributing/implement-langchain.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
