  "content": "Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/app-development\n\n**LangSmith Deployment** builds on the open-source [LangGraph](/oss/python/langgraph/overview) framework for developing stateful, multi-agent applications.\nLangGraph provides the core abstractions and execution model, while LangSmith adds managed infrastructure, observability, deployment options, assistants, and concurrency controls—supporting the full lifecycle from development to production.\n\n<Callout icon=\"cubes\" color=\"#4F46E5\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  LangSmith Deployment is framework-agnostic: you can deploy agents built with LangGraph or [other frameworks](/langsmith/deploy-other-frameworks). To get started with LangGraph itself, refer to the [LangGraph quickstart](/oss/python/langgraph/quickstart).\n</Callout>\n\n<CardGroup>\n  <Card title=\"Assistants\" cta=\"Explore assistants\" href=\"/langsmith/assistants\" icon=\"user-gear\">\n    Manage agent configurations, connect to threads, and build interactive assistants.\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Runs\" cta=\"Learn about runs\" href=\"/langsmith/background-run\" icon=\"play\">\n    Execute background jobs, stateless runs, cron jobs, and manage configurable headers.\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Core capabilities\" cta=\"See core features\" href=\"/langsmith/streaming\" icon=\"gear\">\n    Streaming, human-in-the-loop, webhooks, and concurrency controls like double-texting.\n  </Card>\n\n<Card title=\"Tutorials\" cta=\"View tutorials\" href=\"/langsmith/deploy-other-frameworks\" icon=\"graduation-cap\">\n    Step-by-step examples: AutoGen integration, streaming UI, and generative UI in React.\n  </Card>\n</CardGroup>\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/app-development.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
