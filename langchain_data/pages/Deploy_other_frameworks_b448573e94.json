  "content": "Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/deploy-other-frameworks\n\nThis guide shows you how to use [Functional API](/oss/python/langgraph/functional-api) to deploy a [Strands Agent](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/) on [LangSmith Deployment](/langsmith/deployments) and set up tracing for [LangSmith Observability](/langsmith/observability). You can follow the same approach with other frameworks like CrewAI, AutoGen, Google ADK.\n\nUsing Functional API and deploying to LangSmith Deployment provides several benefits:\n\n* Production deployment: Deploy your integrated solution to [LangSmith Deployment](/langsmith/deployments) for scalable production use.\n* Enhanced features: With Functional API, you can integrate your existing agents with [persistence](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence), [streaming](/langsmith/streaming), [short and long-term memory](/oss/python/concepts/memory) and more, with minimal changes to your existing code.\n* Multi-agent systems: Build [multi-agent systems](/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent) where individual agents are built with different frameworks.\n\n* Python 3.9+\n* Dependencies: `pip install strands-agents strands-agents-tools langgraph`\n* AWS Credentials in your environment\n\n## 1. Define Strands agent\n\nCreate a Strands Agent with pre-built tools.\n\n## 2. Use Functional API to deploy on LangSmith Deployment\n\n[Functional API](/oss/python/langgraph/functional-api) allows you to intergate and deploy with frameworks other than LangChain. Functional API also provides the additional benefit to leverage other key features — persistence, memory, human-in-the-loop, and streaming — coupled with your existing agent, with minimal changes to your existing code.\n\nIt uses two key building blocks:\n\n* **[`@entrypoint`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/func/#langgraph.func.entrypoint)**: Marks a function as the starting point of a workflow, encapsulating logic and managing execution flow, including handling long-running tasks and interrupts.\n* **[`@task`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/func/#langgraph.func.task)**: Represents a discrete unit of work, such as an API call or data processing step, that can be executed asynchronously within an entrypoint. Tasks return a future-like object that can be awaited or resolved synchronously.\n\n## 3. Set up tracing with OpenTelemetry\n\nIn your environment variables, set up the following:\n\n```python  theme={null}",
