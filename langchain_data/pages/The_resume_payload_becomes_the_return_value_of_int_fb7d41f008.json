      "code": "**Key points about resuming:**\n\n* You must use the **same thread ID** when resuming that was used when the interrupt occurred\n* The value passed to `Command(resume=...)` becomes the return value of the [`interrupt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.interrupt) call\n* The node restarts from the beginning of the node where the [`interrupt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.interrupt) was called when resumed, so any code before the [`interrupt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.interrupt) runs again\n* You can pass any JSON-serializable value as the resume value\n\n## Common patterns\n\nThe key thing that interrupts unlock is the ability to pause execution and wait for external input. This is useful for a variety of use cases, including:\n\n* <Icon icon=\"check-circle\" /> [Approval workflows](#approve-or-reject): Pause before executing critical actions (API calls, database changes, financial transactions)\n* <Icon icon=\"pencil\" /> [Review and edit](#review-and-edit-state): Let humans review and modify LLM outputs or tool calls before continuing\n* <Icon icon=\"wrench\" /> [Interrupting tool calls](#interrupts-in-tools): Pause before executing tool calls to review and edit the tool call before execution\n* <Icon icon=\"shield-check\" /> [Validating human input](#validating-human-input): Pause before proceeding to the next step to validate human input\n\n### Approve or reject\n\nOne of the most common uses of interrupts is to pause before a critical action and ask for approval. For example, you might want to ask a human to approve an API call, a database change, or any other important decision.",
