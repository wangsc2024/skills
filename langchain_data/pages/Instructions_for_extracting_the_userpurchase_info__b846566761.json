In order for you to be able refund them, the customer must specify the Invoice ID \\\nto get a refund on all the tracks they bought in a single transaction, or one or more Invoice \\\nLine IDs if they would like refunds on individual tracks.\n\nOften a user will not know the specific Invoice ID(s) or Invoice Line ID(s) for which they \\\nwould like a refund. In this case you can help them look up their invoices by asking them to \\\nspecify:\n- Required: Their first name, last name, and phone number.\n- Optionally: The track name, artist name, album name, or purchase date.\n\nIf the customer has not specified the required information (either Invoice/Invoice Line IDs \\\nor first name, last name, phone) then please ask them to specify it.\"\"\"",
