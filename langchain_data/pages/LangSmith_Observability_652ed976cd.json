Each of these individual steps is represented by a run. You can use [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) to visualize these execution steps. To use it, [enable tracing for your application](/langsmith/trace-with-langgraph). This enables you to do the following:\n\n* [Debug a locally running application](/langsmith/observability-studio#debug-langsmith-traces).\n* [Evaluate the application performance](/oss/python/langchain/evals).\n* [Monitor the application](/langsmith/dashboards).\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you have the following:\n\n* **A LangSmith account**: Sign up (for free) or log in at [smith.langchain.com](https://smith.langchain.com).\n* **A LangSmith API key**: Follow the [Create an API key](/langsmith/create-account-api-key#create-an-api-key) guide.\n\nTo enable tracing for your application, set the following environment variables:\n\nBy default, the trace will be logged to the project with the name `default`. To configure a custom project name, see [Log to a project](#log-to-a-project).\n\nFor more information, see [Trace with LangGraph](/langsmith/trace-with-langgraph).\n\nYou may opt to trace specific invocations or parts of your application using LangSmith's `tracing_context` context manager:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nimport langsmith as ls",
  "code_samples": [
    {
      "code": "By default, the trace will be logged to the project with the name `default`.
