This is especially common when running LangSmith within a Jupyter notebook. Follow these steps to diagnose and resolve the issue:\n\n## 1. Verify your environment variables\n\nFirst, check that the environment variables are set correctly by running:\n\nIf the output does not match what's defined in your .env file, it's likely due to environment variable caching.\n\n## 2. Clear the cache\n\nClear the cached environment variables with the following command:\n\n## 3. Reload the environment variables\n\nReload your environment variables from the .env file by executing:\n\nAfter reloading, your environment variables should be set correctly.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, please reach out to us via a shared Slack channel or email support (available for Plus and Enterprise plans), or in the [LangChain Forum](https://forum.langchain.com/).\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/troubleshooting-variable-caching.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
