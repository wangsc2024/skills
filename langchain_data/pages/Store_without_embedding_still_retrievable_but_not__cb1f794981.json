The `in_memory_store` works hand-in-hand with the checkpointer: the checkpointer saves state to threads, as discussed above, and the `in_memory_store` allows us to store arbitrary information for access *across* threads. We compile the graph with both the checkpointer and the `in_memory_store` as follows.",
