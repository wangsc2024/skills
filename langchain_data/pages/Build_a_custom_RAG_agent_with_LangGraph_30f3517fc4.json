  "content": "Source: https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/agentic-rag\n\nIn this tutorial we will build a [retrieval](/oss/python/langchain/retrieval) agent using LangGraph.\n\nLangChain offers built-in [agent](/oss/python/langchain/agents) implementations, implemented using [LangGraph](/oss/python/langgraph/overview) primitives. If deeper customization is required, agents can be implemented directly in LangGraph. This guide demonstrates an example implementation of a retrieval agent. [Retrieval](/oss/python/langchain/retrieval) agents are useful when you want an LLM to make a decision about whether to retrieve context from a vectorstore or respond to the user directly.\n\nBy the end of the tutorial we will have done the following:\n\n1. Fetch and preprocess documents that will be used for retrieval.\n2. Index those documents for semantic search and create a retriever tool for the agent.\n3. Build an agentic RAG system that can decide when to use the retriever tool.\n\n<img src=\"https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/I6RpA28iE233vhYX/images/langgraph-hybrid-rag-tutorial.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=I6RpA28iE233vhYX&q=85&s=855348219691485642b22a1419939ea7\" alt=\"Hybrid RAG\" data-og-width=\"1615\" width=\"1615\" data-og-height=\"589\" height=\"589\" data-path=\"images/langgraph-hybrid-rag-tutorial.png\" data-optimize=\"true\" data-opv=\"3\" srcset=\"https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/I6RpA28iE233vhYX/images/langgraph-hybrid-rag-tutorial.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=I6RpA28iE233vhYX&q=85&s=09097cb9a1dc57b16d33f084641ea93f 280w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/I6RpA28iE233vhYX/images/langgraph-hybrid-rag-tutorial.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=I6RpA28iE233vhYX&q=85&s=d0bf85cfa36ac7e1a905593a4688f2d2 560w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/I6RpA28iE233vhYX/images/langgraph-hybrid-rag-tutorial.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=I6RpA28iE233vhYX&q=85&s=b7626e6ae3cb94fb90a61e6fad69c8ba 840w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/I6RpA28iE233vhYX/images/langgraph-hybrid-rag-tutorial.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=I6RpA28iE233vhYX&q=85&s=2425baddda7209901bdde4425c23292c 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/I6RpA28iE233vhYX/images/langgraph-hybrid-rag-tutorial.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=I6RpA28iE233vhYX&q=85&s=4e5f030034237589f651b704d0377a76 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/I6RpA28iE233vhYX/images/langgraph-hybrid-rag-tutorial.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=I6RpA28iE233vhYX&q=85&s=3ec3c7c91fd2be4d749b1c267027ac1e 2500w\" />\n\nWe will cover the following concepts:\n\n* [Retrieval](/oss/python/langchain/retrieval) using [document loaders](/oss/python/integrations/document_loaders), [text splitters](/oss/python/integrations/splitters), [embeddings](/oss/python/integrations/text_embedding), and [vector stores](/oss/python/integrations/vectorstores)\n* The LangGraph [Graph API](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api), including state, nodes, edges, and conditional edges.\n\nLet's download the required packages and set our API keys:\n\n<Tip>\n  Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com) lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph.\n</Tip>\n\n## 1. Preprocess documents\n\n1. Fetch documents to use in our RAG system. We will use three of the most recent pages from [Lilian Weng's excellent blog](https://lilianweng.github.io/). We'll start by fetching the content of the pages using `WebBaseLoader` utility:\n\n2. Split the fetched documents into smaller chunks for indexing into our vectorstore:\n\n## 2. Create a retriever tool\n\nNow that we have our split documents, we can index them into a vector store that we'll use for semantic search.\n\n1. Use an in-memory vector store and OpenAI embeddings:\n\n2. Create a retriever tool using the `@tool` decorator:\n\nNow we will start building components ([nodes](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#nodes) and [edges](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#edges)) for our agentic RAG graph.\n\nNote that the components will operate on the [`MessagesState`](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#messagesstate) — graph state that contains a `messages` key with a list of [chat messages](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/messages/).\n\n1. Build a `generate_query_or_respond` node. It will call an LLM to generate a response based on the current graph state (list of messages). Given the input messages, it will decide to retrieve using the retriever tool, or respond directly to the user. Note that we're giving the chat model access to the `retriever_tool` we created earlier via `.bind_tools`:\n\n2. Try it on a random input:\n\n3. Ask a question that requires semantic search:\n\n## 4. Grade documents\n\n1. Add a [conditional edge](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#conditional-edges) — `grade_documents` — to determine whether the retrieved documents are relevant to the question. We will use a model with a structured output schema `GradeDocuments` for document grading. The `grade_documents` function will return the name of the node to go to based on the grading decision (`generate_answer` or `rewrite_question`):\n\n2. Run this with irrelevant documents in the tool response:\n\n3. Confirm that the relevant documents are classified as such:\n\n## 5. Rewrite question\n\n1. Build the `rewrite_question` node. The retriever tool can return potentially irrelevant documents, which indicates a need to improve the original user question. To do so, we will call the `rewrite_question` node:\n\n## 6. Generate an answer\n\n1. Build `generate_answer` node: if we pass the grader checks, we can generate the final answer based on the original question and the retrieved context:\n\n## 7. Assemble the graph\n\nNow we'll assemble all the nodes and edges into a complete graph:\n\n* Start with a `generate_query_or_respond` and determine if we need to call `retriever_tool`\n* Route to next step using `tools_condition`:\n  * If `generate_query_or_respond` returned `tool_calls`, call `retriever_tool` to retrieve context\n  * Otherwise, respond directly to the user\n* Grade retrieved document content for relevance to the question (`grade_documents`) and route to next step:\n  * If not relevant, rewrite the question using `rewrite_question` and then call `generate_query_or_respond` again\n  * If relevant, proceed to `generate_answer` and generate final response using the [`ToolMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.ToolMessage) with the retrieved document context\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode, tools_condition\n\nworkflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)",
