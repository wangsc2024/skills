This tutorial shows how to implement a state machine by using tool calls to dynamically change a single agent's configuration—updating its available tools and instructions based on the current state. The state can be determined from multiple sources: the agent's past actions (tool calls), external state (such as API call results), or even initial user input (for example, by running a classifier to determine user intent).\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll build a customer support agent that does the following:\n\n* Collects warranty information before proceeding.\n* Classifies issues as hardware or software.\n* Provides solutions or escalates to human support.\n* Maintains conversation state across multiple turns.\n\nUnlike the [subagents pattern](/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent/subagents-personal-assistant) where sub-agents are called as tools, the **state machine pattern** uses a single agent whose configuration changes based on workflow progress. Each \"step\" is just a different configuration (system prompt + tools) of the same underlying agent, selected dynamically based on state.\n\nHere's the workflow we'll build:\n\nThis tutorial requires the `langchain` package:\n\nFor more details, see our [Installation guide](/oss/python/langchain/install).\n\nSet up [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com) to inspect what is happening inside your agent.
