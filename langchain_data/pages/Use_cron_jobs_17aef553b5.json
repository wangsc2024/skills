  "content": "Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/cron-jobs\n\nThere are many situations in which it is useful to run an assistant on a schedule.\n\nFor example, say that you're building an assistant that runs daily and sends an email summary\nof the day's news. You could use a cron job to run the assistant every day at 8:00 PM.\n\nLangSmith Deployment supports cron jobs, which run on a user-defined schedule. The user specifies a schedule, an assistant, and some input. After that, on the specified schedule, the server will:\n\n* Create a new thread with the specified assistant\n* Send the specified input to that thread\n\nNote that this sends the same input to the thread every time.\n\nThe LangSmith Deployment API provides several endpoints for creating and managing cron jobs. See the [API reference](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/reference/api/api_ref/) for more details.\n\nSometimes you don't want to run your graph based on user interaction, but rather you would like to schedule your graph to run on a schedule - for example if you wish for your graph to compose and send out a weekly email of to-dos for your team. LangSmith Deployment allows you to do this without having to write your own script by using the `Crons` client. To schedule a graph job, you need to pass a [cron expression](https://crontab.cronhub.io/) to inform the client when you want to run the graph. `Cron` jobs are run in the background and do not interfere with normal invocations of the graph.\n\nFirst, let's set up our SDK client, assistant, and thread:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Python\">\n    \n  </Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"Javascript\">\n    \n  </Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"CURL\">\n    \n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n## Cron job on a thread\n\nTo create a cron job associated with a specific thread, you can write:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Python\">\n    \n  </Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"Javascript\">\n    \n  </Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"CURL\">\n    \n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\nNote that it is **very** important to delete `Cron` jobs that are no longer useful.
