  "content": "Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/self-host-usage\n\nThis guide will walk you through the process of using your self-hosted instance of LangSmith.\n\n<Info>\n  This guide assumes you have already deployed a self-hosted LangSmith instance. If you have not, please refer to the [kubernetes deployment guide](/langsmith/kubernetes) or the [docker deployment guide](/langsmith/docker).\n</Info>\n\n### Configuring the application you want to use with LangSmith\n\nLangSmith has a single API for interacting with both the hub and the LangSmith backend.\n\n1. Once you have deployed your instance, you can access the LangSmith UI at `http(s)://<host>`.\n2. The LangSmith API will be available at `http(s)://<host>/api/v1`\n3. The LangSmith Control Plane will be available at `http(s)://<host>/api-host`\n\nTo use the API of your instance, you will need to set the following environment variables in your application:\n\nYou can also configure these variables directly in the LangSmith SDK client:\n\nAfter setting the above, you should be able to run your code and see the results in your self-hosted instance. We recommend running through the [*quickstart guide*](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/#quick-start) to get a feel for how to use LangSmith.\n\n### Self-Signed Certificates\n\nIf you are using self-signed certificates for your self-hosted LangSmith instance, this can be problematic as Python comes with its own set of trusted certificates, which may not include your self-signed certificate. To resolve this, you may need to use something like `truststore` to load system certificates into your Python environment.\n\nYou can do this like so:\n\n1. pip install truststore (or similar depending on the package manager you are using)\n\nThen use the following code to load the system certificates:\n\n```python  theme={null}\nimport truststore\ntruststore.inject_into_ssl()",
