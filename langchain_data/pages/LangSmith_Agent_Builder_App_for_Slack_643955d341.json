While these models are powerful, they have the potential to generate inaccurate responses, summaries, or other outputs.\n\n### What you should know\n\n* **AI-generated content**: All responses from agents are generated by AI and may contain errors or inaccuracies. Always verify important information.\n* **Data usage**: Slack data is not used to train LLMs. Your workspace data remains private and is only used to provide agent functionality.\n* **Transparency**: The Agent Builder is transparent about the actions it will take once added to your workspace, as outlined in the permissions section above.\n\n### Technical details\n\nThe Agent Builder uses the following approach to AI:\n\n* **Model**: Uses LLMs provided through the LangSmith platform\n* **Data retention**: User data is retained according to LangSmith's data retention policies\n* **Data tenancy**: Data is handled according to your LangSmith organization settings\n* **Data residency**: Data residency follows your LangSmith configuration\n\nFor more information about AI safety and best practices, see the [Agent Builder documentation](/langsmith/agent-builder).\n\nThe LangSmith Agent Builder App for Slack itself does not have any direct pricing.
