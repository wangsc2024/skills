  "content": "Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/add-metadata-tags\n\nLangSmith supports sending arbitrary metadata and tags along with traces.\n\nTags are strings that can be used to categorize or label a trace. Metadata is a dictionary of key-value pairs that can be used to store additional information about a trace.\n\nBoth are useful for associating additional information with a trace, such as the environment in which it was executed, the user who initiated it, or an internal correlation ID. For more information on tags and metadata, see the [Concepts](/langsmith/observability-concepts#tags) page. For information on how to query traces and runs by metadata and tags, see the [Filter traces in the application](/langsmith/filter-traces-in-application) page.\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/add-metadata-tags.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
