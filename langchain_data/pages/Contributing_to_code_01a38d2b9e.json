  "content": "Source: https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/contributing/code\n\nCode contributions are always welcome! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, or improving performance, your contributions help deliver a better developer experience for thousands of developers.\n\n<Note>\n  Before submitting large **new features or refactors**, please first discuss your ideas in [the forum](https://forum.langchain.com/). This ensures alignment with project goals and prevents duplicate work.\n\nThis does not apply to bugfixes or small improvements, which you can contribute directly via pull requests. See the quickstart guide below.\n</Note>\n\n### Quick fix: submit a bugfix\n\nFor simple bugfixes, you can get started immediately:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Reproduce the issue\">\n    Create a minimal test case that demonstrates the bug. Maintainers and other contributors should be able to run this test and see the failure without additional setup or modification\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Fork the repository\">\n    Fork the [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) or [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) repo to your <Tooltip tip=\"If you fork to an organization account, maintainers will be unable to make edits.\">personal GitHub account</Tooltip>\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Clone and setup\">\n\nYou will need to install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) if you haven't previously\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Create a branch\">\n    Create a new branch for your fix. This helps keep your changes organized and makes it easier to submit a pull request later.\n\n<Step title=\"Write failing tests\">\n    Add [unit tests](#test-writing-guidelines) that will fail without your fix. This allows us to verify the bug is resolved and prevents regressions\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Make your changes\">\n    Fix the bug while following our [code quality standards](#code-quality-standards). Make the **minimal change necessary** to resolve the issue. We strongly encourage contributors to comment on the issue before they start coding. For example:\n\n*\"I'd like to work on this. My intended approach would be to \\[...brief description...]. Does this align with maintainer expectations?\"*\n\nA 30-second comment often prevents wasted effort if your initial approach is wrong.\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Verify the fix\">\n    Ensure that tests pass and no regressions are introduced. Ensure all tests pass locally before submitting your PR\n\n<Step title=\"Document the change\">\n    Update docstrings if behavior changes, add comments for complex logic\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Submit a pull request\">\n    Follow the PR template provided. If applicable, reference the issue you're fixing using a [closing keyword](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) (e.g. `Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER`) so that the issue is automatically closed when your PR is merged.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### Full development setup\n\nFor ongoing development or larger contributions:\n\n1. Review our [contribution guidelines](#contribution-guidelines) for features, bugfixes, and integrations\n2. Set up your environment following our [setup guide](#development-environment) below\n3. Understand the [repository structure](#repository-structure) and package organization\n4. Learn our [development workflow](#development-workflow) including testing and linting\n\n## Contribution guidelines\n\nBefore you start contributing to LangChain, take a moment to think about why you want to. If your only goal is to add a \"first contribution\" to your resume (or if you're just looking for a quick win) you might be better off doing a boot-camp or an online tutorial.\n\nContributing to open source projects takes time and effort, but it can also help you become a better developer and learn new skills. However, it's important to know that it might be harder and slower than following a training course. That said, contributing to open source is worth it if you're willing to take the time to do things well.\n\n### Backwards compatibility\n\n<Warning>\n  Breaking changes to public APIs are not allowed except for critical security fixes.\n\nSee our [versioning policy](/oss/python/versioning) for details on major version releases.\n</Warning>\n\nMaintain compatibility via:\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Stable interfaces\">\n    **Always preserve**:\n\n* Function signatures and parameter names\n    * Class interfaces and method names\n    * Return value structure and types\n    * Import paths for public APIs\n  </Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Safe changes\">\n    **Acceptable modifications**:\n\n* Adding new optional parameters\n\n* Adding new methods to classes\n\n* Improving performance without changing behavior\n\n* Adding new modules or functions\n  </Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Before making changes\">\n    * **Would this break existing user code?**\n\n* Check if your target is public\n\n* If needed, is it exported in `__init__.py`?\n\n* Are there existing usage patterns in tests?\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n\nWe aim to keep the bar high for new features. We generally don't accept new core abstractions from outside contributors without an existing issue that demonstrates an acute need for them. This also applies to changes to infra and dependencies.\n\nIn general, feature contribution requirements include:\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Design discussion\">\n    Open an issue describing:\n\n* The problem you're solving\n    * Proposed API design\n    * Expected usage patterns\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Implementation\">\n    * Follow existing code patterns\n    * Include comprehensive tests and documentation\n    * Consider security implications\n  </Step>\n\n<Step title=\"Integration considerations\">\n    * How does this interact with existing features?\n    * Are there performance implications?\n    * Does this introduce new dependencies?\n\nWe will reject features that are likely to lead to security vulnerabilities or reports.\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n### Security guidelines\n\n<Warning>\n  Security is paramount. Never introduce vulnerabilities or unsafe patterns.\n</Warning>\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Input validation\">\n    * Validate and sanitize all user inputs\n    * Properly escape data in templates and queries\n    * Never use `eval()`, `exec()`, or `pickle` on user data, as this can lead to arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities\n  </Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Error handling\">\n    * Use specific exception types\n    * Don't expose sensitive information in error messages\n    * Implement proper resource cleanup\n  </Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Dependencies\">\n    * Avoid adding hard dependencies\n    * Keep optional dependencies minimal\n    * Review third-party packages for security issues\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n\n## Development environment\n\n<Warning>\n  Our Python projects use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for dependency management. Make sure you have the latest version installed.\n</Warning>\n\nOnce you've reviewed the [contribution guidelines](#contribution-guidelines), set up a development environment for the package(s) you're working on.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"LangChain\" icon=\"link\">\n    <AccordionGroup>\n      <Accordion title=\"Core abstractions\">\n        For changes to `langchain-core`:\n\n<Accordion title=\"Main package\">\n        For changes to `langchain`:\n\n<Accordion title=\"Partner packages\">\n        For changes to [partner integrations](/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview):\n\n<Accordion title=\"Community packages\">\n        For changes to community integrations (located in a [separate repo](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-community)):\n\n</Accordion>\n    </AccordionGroup>\n  </Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"LangGraph\" icon=\"circle-nodes\">\n    WIP - coming soon!
