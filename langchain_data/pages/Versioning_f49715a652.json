  "content": "Source: https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/versioning\n\nEach LangChain and LangGraph version number follows the format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`\n\n* **Major**: Breaking API updates that require code changes.\n* **Minor**: New features and improvements that maintain backward compatibility.\n* **Patch**: Bug fixes and minor improvements.\n\nLangChain and LangGraph follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) principles:\n\n* `1.0.0`: First stable release with production-ready APIs\n* `1.1.0`: New features added in a backward-compatible manner\n* `1.0.1`: Backward-compatible bug fixes\n\nWe communicate the stability of our APIs as follows:\n\nAll APIs without special prefixes are considered stable and ready for production use. We maintain backward compatibility for stable features and only introduce breaking changes in major releases.\n\nAPIs marked as `beta` are feature-complete but may undergo minor changes based on user feedback. They are safe for production use but may require small adjustments in future releases.\n\nAPIs marked as `alpha` are experimental and subject to significant changes. Use these with caution in production environments.\n\nAPIs marked as `deprecated` will be removed in future major releases. When possible, we specify the intended version of removal. To handle deprecations:\n\n1. Switch to the recommended alternative API\n2. Follow the migration guide (released alongside major releases)\n3. Use automated migration tools when available\n\nCertain APIs are explicitly marked as \"internal\" in a couple of ways:\n\n* Some documentation refers to internals and mentions them as such. If the documentation says that something is internal, it may change.\n* Functions, methods, and other objects prefixed by a leading underscore (**`_`**). This is the standard Python convention of indicating that something is private; if any method starts with a single **`_`**, it's an internal API.\n  * **Exception:** Certain methods are prefixed with `_` , but do not contain an implementation. These methods are *meant* to be overridden by sub-classes that provide the implementation. Such methods are generally part of the **Public API** of LangChain.\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Major releases\">\n    Major releases (e.g., `1.0.0` → `2.0.0`) may include:\n\n* Breaking API changes\n    * Removal of deprecated features\n    * Significant architectural improvements\n\n* Detailed migration guides\n    * Automated migration tools when possible\n    * Extended support period for the previous major version\n  </Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Minor releases\">\n    Minor releases (e.g., `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`) include:\n\n* New features and capabilities\n    * Performance improvements\n    * New optional parameters\n    * Backward-compatible enhancements\n  </Accordion>\n\n<Accordion title=\"Patch releases\">\n    Patch releases (e.g., `1.0.0` → `1.0.1`) include:\n\n* Bug fixes\n    * Security updates\n    * Documentation improvements\n    * Performance optimizations without API changes\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n\n## Version support policy\n\n* **Latest major version**: Full support with active development (ACTIVE status)\n* **Previous major version**: Security updates and critical bug fixes for 12 months after the next major release (MAINTENANCE status)\n* **Older versions**: Community support only\n\n### Long-term support (LTS) releases\n\nBoth LangChain and LangGraph 1.0 are designated as LTS releases:\n\n* Version 1.0 will remain in ACTIVE status until version 2.0 is released\n* After version 2.0 is released, version 1.0 will enter MAINTENANCE mode for at least 1 year\n* LTS releases follow semantic versioning (semver), allowing safe upgrades between minor versions\n* Legacy versions (LangChain 0.3 and LangGraph 0.4) are in MAINTENANCE mode until December 2026\n\nFor detailed information about release status and support timelines, see the [Release policy](/oss/python/release-policy).\n\n## Check your version\n\nTo check your installed version:\n\n## Pre-release versions\n\nWe occasionally release alpha and beta versions for early testing:\n\n* **Alpha** (e.g., `1.0.0a1`): Early preview, significant changes expected\n* **Beta** (e.g., `1.0.0b1`): Feature-complete, minor changes possible\n* **Release Candidate** (e.g., `1.0.0rc1`): Final testing before stable release\n\n* [Release policy](/oss/python/release-policy) - Detailed release and deprecation policies\n* [Releases](/oss/python/releases) - Version-specific release notes and migration guides\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/oss/versioning.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
