  "content": "Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/trajectory-evals\n\nMany agent behaviors only emerge when using a real LLM, such as which tool the agent decides to call, how it formats responses, or whether a prompt modification affects the entire execution trajectory. LangChain's [`agentevals`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agentevals) package provides evaluators specifically designed for testing agent trajectories with live models.\n\n<Note>\n  This guide covers the open source [LangChain](/oss/python/langchain/overview) `agentevals` package, which integrates with LangSmith for trajectory evaluation.\n</Note>\n\nAgentEvals allows you to evaluate the trajectory of your agent (the exact sequence of messages, including tool calls) by performing a *trajectory match* or by using an *LLM judge*:\n\n<Card title=\"Trajectory match\" icon=\"equals\" arrow=\"true\" href=\"#trajectory-match-evaluator\">\n  Hard-code a reference trajectory for a given input and validate the run via a step-by-step comparison.\n\nIdeal for testing well-defined workflows where you know the expected behavior. Use when you have specific expectations about which tools should be called and in what order. This approach is deterministic, fast, and cost-effective since it doesn't require additional LLM calls.\n</Card>\n\n<Card title=\"LLM-as-judge\" icon=\"gavel\" arrow=\"true\" href=\"#llm-as-judge-evaluator\">\n  Use a LLM to qualitatively validate your agent's execution trajectory. The \"judge\" LLM reviews the agent's decisions against a prompt rubric (which can include a reference trajectory).\n\nMore flexible and can assess nuanced aspects like efficiency and appropriateness, but requires an LLM call and is less deterministic. Use when you want to evaluate the overall quality and reasonableness of the agent's trajectory without strict tool call or ordering requirements.\n</Card>\n\n## Installing AgentEvals\n\nOr, clone the [AgentEvals repository](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agentevals) directly.\n\n## Trajectory match evaluator\n\nAgentEvals offers the `create_trajectory_match_evaluator` function in Python and `createTrajectoryMatchEvaluator` in TypeScript to match your agent's trajectory against a reference trajectory.\n\nYou can use the following modes:\n\n| Mode                                     | Description                                               | Use Case                                                              |\n| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [`strict`](#strict-match)                | Exact match of messages and tool calls in the same order  | Testing specific sequences (e.g., policy lookup before authorization) |\n| [`unordered`](#unordered-match)          | Same tool calls allowed in any order                      | Verifying information retrieval when order doesn't matter             |\n| [`subset`](#subset-and-superset-match)   | Agent calls only tools from reference (no extras)         | Ensuring agent doesn't exceed expected scope                          |\n| [`superset`](#subset-and-superset-match) | Agent calls at least the reference tools (extras allowed) | Verifying minimum required actions are taken                          |\n\nThe `strict` mode ensures trajectories contain identical messages in the same order with the same tool calls, though it allows for differences in message content. This is useful when you need to enforce a specific sequence of operations, such as requiring a policy lookup before authorizing an action.\n\nThe `unordered` mode allows the same tool calls in any order, which is helpful when you want to verify that the correct set of tools are being invoked but don't care about the sequence. For example, an agent might need to check both weather and events for a city, but the order doesn't matter.\n\n### Subset and superset match\n\nThe `superset` and `subset` modes focus on which tools are called rather than the order of tool calls, allowing you to control how strictly the agent's tool calls must align with the reference.\n\n* Use `superset` mode when you want to verify that a few key tools are called in the execution, but you're okay with the agent calling additional tools. The agent's trajectory must include at least all the tool calls in the reference trajectory, and may include additional tool calls beyond the reference.\n* Use `subset` mode to ensure agent efficiency by verifying that the agent did not call any irrelevant or unnecessary tools beyond those in the reference. The agent's trajectory must include only tool calls that appear in the reference trajectory.\n\nThe following example demonstrates `superset` mode, where the reference trajectory only requires the `get_weather` tool, but the agent can call additional tools:\n\n<Info>\n  You can also customize how the evaluator considers equality between tool calls in the actual trajectory vs. the reference by setting the `tool_args_match_mode` (Python) or `toolArgsMatchMode` (TypeScript) property, as well as the `tool_args_match_overrides` (Python) or `toolArgsMatchOverrides` (TypeScript) property. By default, only tool calls with the same arguments to the same tool are considered equal. Visit the [repository](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agentevals?tab=readme-ov-file#tool-args-match-modes) for more details.\n</Info>\n\n## LLM-as-judge evaluator\n\n<Note>\n  This section covers the trajectory-specific LLM-as-a-judge evaluator from the `agentevals` package. For general-purpose LLM-as-a-judge evaluators in LangSmith, refer to the [LLM-as-a-judge evaluator](/langsmith/llm-as-judge).\n</Note>\n\nYou can also use an LLM to evaluate the agent's execution path. Unlike the trajectory match evaluators, it doesn't require a reference trajectory, but one can be provided if available.\n\n### Without reference trajectory\n\n### With reference trajectory\n\nIf you have a reference trajectory, you can add an extra variable to your prompt and pass in the reference trajectory. Below, we use the prebuilt `TRAJECTORY_ACCURACY_PROMPT_WITH_REFERENCE` prompt and configure the `reference_outputs` variable:\n\n<Info>\n  For more configurability over how the LLM evaluates the trajectory, visit the [repository](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agentevals?tab=readme-ov-file#trajectory-llm-as-judge).\n</Info>\n\n## Async support (Python)\n\nAll `agentevals` evaluators support Python asyncio. For evaluators that use factory functions, async versions are available by adding `async` after `create_` in the function name.\n\nHere's an example using the async judge and evaluator:\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/trajectory-evals.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
