  "content": "Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/openapi-security\n\nThis guide shows how to customize the OpenAPI security schema for your LangSmith API documentation. A well-documented security schema helps API consumers understand how to authenticate with your API and even enables automatic client generation. See the [Authentication & Access Control conceptual guide](/langsmith/auth) for more details about LangGraph's authentication system.\n\n<Note>\n  **Implementation vs Documentation**\n  This guide only covers how to document your security requirements in OpenAPI. To implement the actual authentication logic, see [How to add custom authentication](/langsmith/custom-auth).\n</Note>\n\nThis guide applies to all LangSmith deployments (Cloud and self-hosted). It does not apply to usage of the LangGraph open source library if you are not using LangSmith.\n\nThe default security scheme varies by deployment type:\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"LangSmith\" />\n</Tabs>\n\nBy default, LangSmith requires a LangSmith API key in the `x-api-key` header:\n\nWhen using one of the LangGraph SDK's, this can be inferred from environment variables.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"Self-hosted\" />\n</Tabs>\n\nBy default, self-hosted deployments have no security scheme. This means they are to be deployed only on a secured network or with authentication. To add custom authentication, see [How to add custom authentication](/langsmith/custom-auth).\n\n## Custom Security Schema\n\nTo customize the security schema in your OpenAPI documentation, add an `openapi` field to your `auth` configuration in `langgraph.json`. Remember that this only updates the API documentation - you must also implement the corresponding authentication logic as shown in [How to add custom authentication](/langsmith/custom-auth).\n\nNote that LangSmith does not provide authentication endpoints - you'll need to handle user authentication in your client application and pass the resulting credentials to the LangGraph API.\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"OAuth2 with Bearer Token\">\n    \n  </Tab>\n\n<Tab title=\"API Key\">\n    \n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\nAfter updating your configuration:\n\n1. Deploy your application\n2. Visit `/docs` to see the updated OpenAPI documentation\n3. Try out the endpoints using credentials from your authentication server (make sure you've implemented the authentication logic first)\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/openapi-security.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
