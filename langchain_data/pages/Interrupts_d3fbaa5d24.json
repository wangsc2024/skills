This enables human-in-the-loop patterns where you need external input to proceed. When an interrupt is triggered, LangGraph saves the graph state using its [persistence](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence) layer and waits indefinitely until you resume execution.\n\nInterrupts work by calling the `interrupt()` function at any point in your graph nodes. The function accepts any JSON-serializable value which is surfaced to the caller. When you're ready to continue, you resume execution by re-invoking the graph using `Command`, which then becomes the return value of the `interrupt()` call from inside the node.\n\nUnlike static breakpoints (which pause before or after specific nodes), interrupts are **dynamic**—they can be placed anywhere in your code and can be conditional based on your application logic.\n\n* **Checkpointing keeps your place:** the checkpointer writes the exact graph state so you can resume later, even when in an error state.\n* **`thread_id` is your pointer:** set `config={\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": ...}}` to tell the checkpointer which state to load.\n* **Interrupt payloads surface as `__interrupt__`:** the values you pass to `interrupt()` return to the caller in the `__interrupt__` field so you know what the graph is waiting on.\n\nThe `thread_id` you choose is effectively your persistent cursor. Reusing it resumes the same checkpoint; using a new value starts a brand-new thread with an empty state.\n\n## Pause using `interrupt`\n\nThe [`interrupt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.interrupt) function pauses graph execution and returns a value to the caller. When you call [`interrupt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.interrupt) within a node, LangGraph saves the current graph state and waits for you to resume execution with input.\n\nTo use [`interrupt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.interrupt), you need:\n\n1. A **checkpointer** to persist the graph state (use a durable checkpointer in production)\n2. A **thread ID** in your config so the runtime knows which state to resume from\n3. To call `interrupt()` where you want to pause (payload must be JSON-serializable)\n\nWhen you call [`interrupt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.interrupt), here's what happens:\n\n1. **Graph execution gets suspended** at the exact point where [`interrupt`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/#langgraph.types.interrupt) is called\n2. **State is saved** using the checkpointer so execution can be resumed later, In production, this should be a persistent checkpointer (e.g. backed by a database)\n3. **Value is returned** to the caller under `__interrupt__`; it can be any JSON-serializable value (string, object, array, etc.)\n4. **Graph waits indefinitely** until you resume execution with a response\n5. **Response is passed back** into the node when you resume, becoming the return value of the `interrupt()` call\n\n## Resuming interrupts\n\nAfter an interrupt pauses execution, you resume the graph by invoking it again with a `Command` that contains the resume value. The resume value is passed back to the `interrupt` call, allowing the node to continue execution with the external input.\n\n```python  theme={null}\nfrom langgraph.types import Command",
