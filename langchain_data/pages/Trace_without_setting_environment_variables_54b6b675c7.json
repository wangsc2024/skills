  "content": "Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/trace-without-env-vars\n\nAs mentioned in other guides, the following environment variables allow you to configure tracing enabled, the api endpoint, the api key, and the tracing project:\n\n* `LANGSMITH_TRACING`\n* `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`\n* `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT`\n* `LANGSMITH_PROJECT`\n\nIf you need to trace runs with a custom configuration, are working in an environment that doesn’t support typical environment variables (such as Cloudflare Workers), or would simply prefer not to rely on environment variables, LangSmith allows you to configure tracing programmatically.\n\n<Warning>\n  Due to a number of asks for finer-grained control of tracing using the `trace` context manager, **we changed the behavior** of `with trace` to honor the `LANGSMITH_TRACING` environment variable in version **0.1.95** of the Python SDK. You can find more details in the [release notes](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-sdk/releases/tag/v0.1.95). The recommended way to disable/enable tracing without setting environment variables is to use the `with tracing_context` context manager, as shown in the example below.\n</Warning>\n\n* Python: The recommended way to do this in Python is to use the `tracing_context` context manager. This works for both code annotated with `traceable` and code within the `trace` context manager.\n* TypeScript: You can pass in both the client and the `tracingEnabled` flag to the `traceable` decorator.\n\nIf you prefer a video tutorial, check out the [Alternative Ways to Trace video](https://academy.langchain.com/pages/intro-to-langsmith-preview) from the Introduction to LangSmith Course.\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/trace-without-env-vars.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
