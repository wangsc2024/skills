For more detailed information on configuration, see the [Trace With LangChain](/langsmith/trace-with-langchain) guide.\n\nInstall the LangGraph library and the OpenAI integration for Python and JS (we use the OpenAI integration for the code snippets below).\n\nFor a full list of packages available, see the [LangChain Python docs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/platforms/) and [LangChain JS docs](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/platforms/).\n\n### 2.
