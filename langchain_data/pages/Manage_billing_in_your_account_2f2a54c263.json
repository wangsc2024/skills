  "content": "Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/billing\n\nThis page describes how to manage billing for your LangSmith organization:\n\n* [Set up billing for your account](#set-up-billing-for-your-account): Complete the billing setup process for Developer and Plus plans, including special instructions for legacy accounts.\n* [Update your information](#update-your-information): Modify invoice email addresses, business information, and tax IDs for your organization.\n* [Enforce spend limits](#enforce-spend-limits): Learn how to manage your spend through usage limits and data retention.\n\n## Set up billing for your account\n\n<Note>\n  Before using this guide, note the following:\n\n* If you are interested in the [Enterprise](https://www.langchain.com/pricing) plan, please [contact sales](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales). This guide is only for our self-serve billing plans.\n</Note>\n\nTo set up billing for your LangSmith organization, navigate to the [Billing and Usage](https://smith.langchain.com/settings/payments) page under **Settings**. Depending on your organization's settings, there are different setup guides:\n\n* [Developer plan](#developer-plan%3A-set-up-billing-on-your-personal-organization)\n* [Plus plan](#plus-plan%3A-set-up-billing-on-a-shared-organization)\n\n### Developer Plan: set up billing on your personal organization\n\nPersonal organizations are limited to 5,000 traces per month until a credit card is added. To add a card:\n\n1. Click **Add card to remove trace limit**.\n2. Add your credit card information.\n3. Once complete, you will no longer be rate limited to 5,000 traces, and you will be charged for any excess traces at rates specified on the [pricing](https://www.langchain.com/pricing-langsmith) page.\n\n### Plus Plan: set up billing on a shared organization\n\nTeam organizations are given an initial 10,000 traces per month. Any excess traces will be charged at rates specified on the [pricing](https://www.langchain.com/pricing-langsmith) page.\n\n<Note>\n  New organizations that you manually create are required to be on the Plus Plan. If you see a message about needing to upgrade to Plus to use this organization, follow these steps.\n</Note>\n\n1. Click **Upgrade to Plus**.\n2. Invite members to your organization, as desired.\n3. Enter your credit card information. Then, enter business information, invoice email, and tax ID. If this organization belongs to a business, check the **This is a business** checkbox and enter the information accordingly. For more information, refer to the [Update your information section](#update-your-information).\n\n## Update your information (Paid plans only)\n\nTo update business information for your LangSmith organization, head to the [Billing and Usage](https://smith.langchain.com/settings/payments) page under **Settings**.\n\nTo update the email address for invoices, follow these steps:\n\n1. Navigate to the **Plans and Billing** tab.\n2. Locate the section beneath the payment method, where the current invoice email is displayed.\n3. Enter the new email address for invoices in the provided field.\n4. The new email address will be automatically saved.\n\nYou will receive all future invoices to the updated email address.\n\n### Business information and tax ID\n\n<Note>\n  In certain jurisdictions, LangSmith is required to collect sales tax. If you are a business, providing your tax ID may qualify you for a sales tax exemption.\n</Note>\n\nTo update your organization's business information, follow these steps:\n\n1. Navigate to the **Plans and Billing** tab.\n2. Below the invoice email section, you will find a checkbox labeled **Business**.\n3. Check the **Business** checkbox if your organization belongs to a business.\n4. A business information section will appear, allowing you to enter or update the following details:\n   * Business Name\n   * Address\n   * Tax ID for applicable jurisdictions\n5. A Tax ID field will appear for applicable jurisdictions after you select a country.\n6. After entering the necessary information, click the **Save** button to save your changes.\n\nThis ensures that your business information is up-to-date and accurate for billing and tax purposes.\n\n## Enforce spend limits\n\n<Check>\n  You may find it helpful to read the following pages, before continuing with this section on optimizing your tracing spend:\n\n* [Data Retention Conceptual Docs](/langsmith/administration-overview#data-retention)\n  * [Usage Limiting Conceptual Docs](/langsmith/administration-overview#usage-limits)\n</Check>\n\n<Note>\n  Some of the features mentioned in this guide are not currently available on Enterprise plan due to its custom nature of billing. If you are on the Enterprise plan and have questions about cost optimization, contact your sales rep or support via [support.langchain.com](https://support.langchain.com).\n</Note>\n\n### Understand your current usage\n\nThe first step of any optimization process is to understand current usage. LangSmith provides two ways to do this: [Usage graph](#usage-graph) and [Invoices](#invoices).\n\nLangSmith Usage is measured per workspace, because workspaces often represent development environments (as in the example), or teams within an organization.\n\nThe usage graph lets you examine how much of each usage-based pricing metric you have consumed. It does not directly show spend (which you will review later in the draft invoice).\n\nNavigate to the usage graph under **Settings** -> **Billing and Usage** -> **Usage Graph**.\n\nThere are several usage metrics that LangSmith charges for:\n\n* LangSmith Traces (Base Charge): tracks all traces that you send to LangSmith.\n* LangSmith Traces (Extended Data Retention Upgrades): tracks all traces that also have our Extended 400 Day Data Retention.\n* LangSmith Deployment Agent Runs: tracks end-to-end invocations of deployed LangGraph agents.\n\nFor more details on traces, refer to the [data retention conceptual docs](/langsmith/administration-overview#data-retention). For more details on Agent Runs, refer to [LangSmith Deployment billing](#langsmith-deployment-billing).\n\nTo understand how your usage translates to spend, navigate to the **Invoices** tab. The first invoice that will appear on screen is a draft of your current month's invoice, which shows your running spend thus far this month.\n\n<Note>\n  LangSmith's Usage Graph and Invoice use the term `tenant_id` to refer to a workspace ID. They are interchangeable.\n</Note>\n\n### Set limits on usage\n\n<img src=\"https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/-XAfdD9knKGGfZBx/langsmith/images/p2usagelimitsempty-v2.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=-XAfdD9knKGGfZBx&q=85&s=27addecc92b87dd4131683fb8500f96c\" alt=\"P2usagelimitsempty v2\" data-og-width=\"2598\" width=\"2598\" data-og-height=\"1582\" height=\"1582\" data-path=\"langsmith/images/p2usagelimitsempty-v2.png\" data-optimize=\"true\" data-opv=\"3\" srcset=\"https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/-XAfdD9knKGGfZBx/langsmith/images/p2usagelimitsempty-v2.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=-XAfdD9knKGGfZBx&q=85&s=1b544ddf00fd88a470ec19db0283a9ec 280w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/-XAfdD9knKGGfZBx/langsmith/images/p2usagelimitsempty-v2.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=-XAfdD9knKGGfZBx&q=85&s=91a0e4559da14d35d8644e20ff2210ec 560w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/-XAfdD9knKGGfZBx/langsmith/images/p2usagelimitsempty-v2.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=-XAfdD9knKGGfZBx&q=85&s=0f77081378606e6bb4061e4c7b694381 840w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/-XAfdD9knKGGfZBx/langsmith/images/p2usagelimitsempty-v2.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=-XAfdD9knKGGfZBx&q=85&s=e5ea7731ac5e71276ed58f8f8df03d18 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/-XAfdD9knKGGfZBx/langsmith/images/p2usagelimitsempty-v2.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=-XAfdD9knKGGfZBx&q=85&s=f36ec6fc852a08f1d83bb8e0a0cc0fa8 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/-XAfdD9knKGGfZBx/langsmith/images/p2usagelimitsempty-v2.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=-XAfdD9knKGGfZBx&q=85&s=88f9537239e3a5250b056070d3b57a93 2500w\" />\n\n#### Set spend limit for workspace\n\n1. To set limits, navigate to **Settings** -> **Billing and Usage** -> **Usage limits**.\n2. Input a spend limit for your selected workspace. LangSmith will determine an appropriate number of base and extended trace limits to match that spend. The trace limits include the free trace allocation that comes with your plan (see details on [pricing page](https://smith.langchain.com/settings/payments)).\n\n<Note>\n  For organizations with **multiple workspaces only**: For simplicity, LangSmith incorporates the free traces into the cost calculation of the **first workspace only**. In actuality, the free traces can be \"consumed\" by any workspace. Therefore, although workspace-level spend limits are approximate for multi-workspace organizations, the organization-level spend limit is absolute.\n</Note>\n\n#### Configure trace tier distrubution\n\nLangSmith has two trace tiers: base traces and extended traces. Base traces have the base retention and are short-lived (14 days), while extended traces have extended retention and are long-lived (400 days). For more information, refer to the [data retention conceptual docs](/langsmith/administration-overview#data-retention).\n\nSet the desired default trace tier by selecting an option below the **Default data retention** label. All traces will have this tier by default when they are registered. Note that because extended traces cost more than base traces, selecting **Extended** as your default data retention option will result in less overall traces allowed in the billing period. By default, updating this setting will only apply to future incoming traces. To apply to all existing traces in the workspace, select the checkbox.\n\nIf the default data retention is set to **Base** you can optionally use the slider to distribute trace limits across base and extended tracess. LangSmith automatically provides a suggestion for this distribution but you can tailor this to your needs. For example, if you are running lots of automations or other features that may upgrade a trace to extended, you may want to increase your extended trace limits. To see the complete list of features that may upgrade a trace, [see here](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/administration-overview#how-it-works:~:text=Data%20retention%20auto%2Dupgrades).\n\n<Note>\n  The extended data retention limit can cause features other than tracing to stop working once reached. If you plan to use this feature, read more about its [functionality and side effects](/langsmith/administration-overview#side-effects-of-extended-data-retention-traces-limit).\n</Note>\n\n### Other methods of managing traces\n\n#### Change project-level default retention\n\nData retention settings are adjustable per tracing project.\n\nNavigate to **Projects** > ***Your project name*** > Select **Retention** and select the desired default retention. This will only affect retention (and pricing) for **traces going forward**.\n\n<img src=\"https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/H9jA2WRyA-MV4-H0/langsmith/images/p1projectretention.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=H9jA2WRyA-MV4-H0&q=85&s=394b513df5ef31d0309f5f3c78bd315a\" alt=\"P1projectretention\" data-og-width=\"1358\" width=\"1358\" data-og-height=\"452\" height=\"452\" data-path=\"langsmith/images/p1projectretention.png\" data-optimize=\"true\" data-opv=\"3\" srcset=\"https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/H9jA2WRyA-MV4-H0/langsmith/images/p1projectretention.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=H9jA2WRyA-MV4-H0&q=85&s=0ebc83ac05d14858da153e707bd02f6b 280w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/H9jA2WRyA-MV4-H0/langsmith/images/p1projectretention.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=H9jA2WRyA-MV4-H0&q=85&s=0baaf55ed3a4719c2b3c3545778e1ded 560w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/H9jA2WRyA-MV4-H0/langsmith/images/p1projectretention.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=H9jA2WRyA-MV4-H0&q=85&s=30989a6636683bca7e456ea1897c2986 840w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/H9jA2WRyA-MV4-H0/langsmith/images/p1projectretention.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=H9jA2WRyA-MV4-H0&q=85&s=ee7c87a83e1a15bc4d843bae3ad32811 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/H9jA2WRyA-MV4-H0/langsmith/images/p1projectretention.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=H9jA2WRyA-MV4-H0&q=85&s=7947cbde975873a53d197019453485e5 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/H9jA2WRyA-MV4-H0/langsmith/images/p1projectretention.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=H9jA2WRyA-MV4-H0&q=85&s=53e1f6edb92789ee5034d5f7f1153af6 2500w\" />\n\n#### Apply extended data retention to a percentage of traces\n\nYou may not want all traces to expire after 14 days. You can automatically extend the retention of traces that match some criteria by creating an [automation rule](/langsmith/rules). You might want to apply extended data retention to specific types of traces, such as:\n\n* 10% of all traces: For general analysis or analyzing trends long term.\n* Errored traces: To investigate and debug issues thoroughly.\n* Traces with specific metadata: For long-term examination of particular features or user flows.\n\n1. Navigate to **Projects** > ***Your project name*** > Select **+ New** > Select **New Automation**.\n2. Name your rule and optionally apply filters or a sample rate. For more information on configuring filters, refer to [filtering techniques](/langsmith/filter-traces-in-application#filter-operators).\n\n<Note>\n  When an automation rule matches any [run](/langsmith/observability-concepts#runs) within a [trace](/langsmith/observability-concepts#traces), then all runs within the trace are upgraded to be retained for 400 days.\n</Note>\n\nFor example, this is the expected configuration to keep 10% of all traces for extended data retention:\n\n<img src=\"https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/Xbr8HuVd9jPi6qTU/langsmith/images/P2SampleTraces.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Xbr8HuVd9jPi6qTU&q=85&s=09bbdf5ef7cf3a5a99d6bf0a704e2143\" alt=\"P2sampletraces\" data-og-width=\"640\" width=\"640\" data-og-height=\"610\" height=\"610\" data-path=\"langsmith/images/P2SampleTraces.png\" data-optimize=\"true\" data-opv=\"3\" srcset=\"https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/Xbr8HuVd9jPi6qTU/langsmith/images/P2SampleTraces.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=Xbr8HuVd9jPi6qTU&q=85&s=b40ff90a0e3ef5f52ecda25965ec1daa 280w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/Xbr8HuVd9jPi6qTU/langsmith/images/P2SampleTraces.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=Xbr8HuVd9jPi6qTU&q=85&s=4381f3239c4d5c71c8ccd9dcdb4fe859 560w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/Xbr8HuVd9jPi6qTU/langsmith/images/P2SampleTraces.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=Xbr8HuVd9jPi6qTU&q=85&s=81da02c26dcc067fbbc4a4d7de318dee 840w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/Xbr8HuVd9jPi6qTU/langsmith/images/P2SampleTraces.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=Xbr8HuVd9jPi6qTU&q=85&s=5f703039c242ba31d192fdb8f4742362 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/Xbr8HuVd9jPi6qTU/langsmith/images/P2SampleTraces.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=Xbr8HuVd9jPi6qTU&q=85&s=e293a6cca1f7da6c8ca62b64e249f6b2 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/langchain-5e9cc07a/Xbr8HuVd9jPi6qTU/langsmith/images/P2SampleTraces.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=Xbr8HuVd9jPi6qTU&q=85&s=558b6d18d598241a2f81e8327b13ce3d 2500w\" />\n\nIf you want to keep a subset of traces for **longer than 400 days** for data collection purposes, you can create another run rule that sends some runs to a dataset of your choosing. A dataset allows you to store the trace inputs and outputs (e.g., as a key-value dataset), and will persist indefinitely, even after the trace gets deleted.\n\n### LangSmith Deployment billing\n\nIn addition to traces, LangSmith charges for deployed agents via LangSmith Deployment (formerly LangGraph Platform).\n\n* **Agent Runs**: An Agent Run is one end-to-end invocation of a deployed LangGraph agent and is billed at \\$0.005 each. Nodes and subgraphs within a single agent execution are not charged separately. Calls to other LangGraph agents are charged separately to the deployment hosting the called agent. When using human-in-the-loop with interrupts, resuming after an interrupt creates a separate Agent Run.\n* **Deployment Uptime**: You are also charged for the time your deployment's database is live and persisting state. See the [pricing page](https://www.langchain.com/pricing) for uptime costs by deployment type (Development vs Production).\n\nFor high-volume deployment usage, please [contact our sales team](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales) to discuss custom pricing options.\n\nIf you have questions about further managing your spend, please contact support via [support.langchain.com](https://support.langchain.com).\n\n<Callout icon=\"pen-to-square\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/billing.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).\n</Callout>\n\n<Tip icon=\"terminal\" iconType=\"regular\">\n  [Connect these docs](/use-these-docs) to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.\n</Tip>",
