This guide will help you install and configure React Compiler in your React application.

React Compiler is designed to work best with React 19, but it also supports React 17 and 18. Learn more about React version compatibility.

Install React Compiler as a devDependency:

React Compiler is designed to work by default without any configuration. However, if you need to configure it in special circumstances (for example, to target React versions below 19), refer to the compiler options reference.

The setup process depends on your build tool. React Compiler includes a Babel plugin that integrates with your build pipeline.

React Compiler must run first in your Babel plugin pipeline. The compiler needs the original source information for proper analysis, so it must process your code before other transformations.

Create or update your babel.config.js:

If you use Vite, you can add the plugin to vite-plugin-react:

Alternatively, if you prefer a separate Babel plugin for Vite:

Please refer to the Next.js docs for more information.

Install vite-plugin-babel, and add the compiler’s Babel plugin to it:

A community webpack loader is now available here.

Please refer to Expo’s docs to enable and use the React Compiler in Expo apps.

React Native uses Babel via Metro, so refer to the Usage with Babel section for installation instructions.

Please refer to Rspack’s docs to enable and use the React Compiler in Rspack apps.

Please refer to Rsbuild’s docs to enable and use the React Compiler in Rsbuild apps.

React Compiler includes an ESLint rule that helps identify code that can’t be optimized. When the ESLint rule reports an error, it means the compiler will skip optimizing that specific component or hook. This is safe: the compiler will continue optimizing other parts of your codebase. You don’t need to fix all violations immediately. Address them at your own pace to gradually increase the number of optimized components.

Install the ESLint plugin:

If you haven’t already configured eslint-plugin-react-hooks, follow the installation instructions in the readme. The compiler rules are available in the recommended-latest preset.

The ESLint rule will:

After installation, verify that React Compiler is working correctly.

Components optimized by React Compiler will show a “Memo ✨” badge in React DevTools:

If the compiler is working:

You can also verify the compiler is running by checking your build output. The compiled code will include automatic memoization logic that the compiler adds automatically.

If a component is causing issues after compilation, you can temporarily opt it out using the "use no memo" directive:

This tells the compiler to skip optimization for this specific component. You should fix the underlying issue and remove the directive once resolved.

For more troubleshooting help, see the debugging guide.

Now that you have React Compiler installed, learn more about:

**Examples:**

Example 1 (python):
```python
npm install -D babel-plugin-react-compiler@latest
```

Example 2 (python):
```python
yarn add -D babel-plugin-react-compiler@latest
```

Example 3 (python):
```python
pnpm install -D babel-plugin-react-compiler@latest
```

Example 4 (css):
```css
module.exports = {  plugins: [    'babel-plugin-react-compiler', // must run first!    // ... other plugins  ],  // ... other config};
```

React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption. You can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to an HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, this section will help you get started.

You don’t need to install anything to play with React. Try editing this sandbox!

You can edit it directly or open it in a new tab by pressing the “Fork” button in the upper right corner.

Most pages in the React documentation contain sandboxes like this. Outside of the React documentation, there are many online sandboxes that support React: for example, CodeSandbox, StackBlitz, or CodePen.

To try React locally on your computer, download this HTML page. Open it in your editor and in your browser!

If you want to start a new React app, you can create a React app using a recommended framework.

If a framework is not a good fit for your project, you prefer to build your own framework, or you just want to learn the basics of a React app you can build a React app from scratch.

If want to try using React in your existing app or a website, you can add React to an existing project.

No. Create React App has been deprecated. For more information, see Sunsetting Create React App.

You will build a small tic-tac-toe game during this tutorial. This tutorial does not assume any existing React knowledge. The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building any React app, and fully understanding it will give you a deep understanding of React.

This tutorial is designed for people who prefer to learn by doing and want to quickly try making something tangible. If you prefer learning each concept step by step, start with Describing the UI.

The tutorial is divided into several sections:

In this tutorial, you’ll build an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React.

You can see what it will look like when you’re finished here:

If the code doesn’t make sense to you yet, or if you are unfamiliar with the code’s syntax, don’t worry! The goal of this tutorial is to help you understand React and its syntax.

We recommend that you check out the tic-tac-toe game above before continuing with the tutorial. One of the features that you’ll notice is that there is a numbered list to the right of the game’s board. This list gives you a history of all of the moves that have occurred in the game, and it is updated as the game progresses.

Once you’ve played around with the finished tic-tac-toe game, keep scrolling. You’ll start with a simpler template in this tutorial. Our next step is to set you up so that you can start building the game.

In the live code editor below, click Fork in the top-right corner to open the editor in a new tab using the website CodeSandbox. CodeSandbox lets you write code in your browser and preview how your users will see the app you’ve created. The new tab should display an empty square and the starter code for this tutorial.

You can also follow this tutorial using your local development environment. To do this, you need to:

If you get stuck, don’t let this stop you! Follow along online instead and try a local setup again later.

Now that you’re set up, let’s get an overview of React!

In CodeSandbox you’ll see three main sections:

The App.js file should be selected in the Files section. The contents of that file in the code editor should be:

The browser section should be displaying a square with an X in it like this:

Now let’s have a look at the files in the starter code.

The code in App.js creates a component. In React, a component is a piece of reusable code that represents a part of a user interface. Components are used to render, manage, and update the UI elements in your application. Let’s look at the component line by line to see what’s going on:

The first line defines a function called Square. The export JavaScript keyword makes this function accessible outside of this file. The default keyword tells other files using your code that it’s the main function in your file.

The second line returns a button. The return JavaScript keyword means whatever comes after is returned as a value to the caller of the function. <button> is a JSX element. A JSX element is a combination of JavaScript code and HTML tags that describes what you’d like to display. className="square" is a button property or prop that tells CSS how to style the button. X is the text displayed inside of the button and </button> closes the JSX element to indicate that any following content shouldn’t be placed inside the button.

Click on the file labeled styles.css in the Files section of CodeSandbox. This file defines the styles for your React app. The first two CSS selectors (* and body) define the style of large parts of your app while the .square selector defines the style of any component where the className property is set to square. In your code, that would match the button from your Square component in the App.js file.

Click on the file labeled index.js in the Files section of CodeSandbox. You won’t be editing this file during the tutorial but it is the bridge between the component you created in the App.js file and the web browser.

Lines 1-5 bring all the necessary pieces together:

The remainder of the file brings all the pieces together and injects the final product into index.html in the public folder.

Let’s get back to App.js. This is where you’ll spend the rest of the tutorial.

Currently the board is only a single square, but you need nine! If you just try and copy paste your square to make two squares like this:

You’ll get this error:

React components need to return a single JSX element and not multiple adjacent JSX elements like two buttons. To fix this you can use Fragments (<> and </>) to wrap multiple adjacent JSX elements like this:

Great! Now you just need to copy-paste a few times to add nine squares and…

Oh no! The squares are all in a single line, not in a grid like you need for our board. To fix this you’ll need to group your squares into rows with divs and add some CSS classes. While you’re at it, you’ll give each square a number to make sure you know where each square is displayed.

In the App.js file, update the Square component to look like this:

The CSS defined in styles.css styles the divs with the className of board-row. Now that you’ve grouped your components into rows with the styled divs you have your tic-tac-toe board:

But you now have a problem. Your component named Square, really isn’t a square anymore. Let’s fix that by changing the name to Board:

At this point your code should look something like this:

Psssst… That’s a lot to type! It’s okay to copy and paste code from this page. However, if you’re up for a little challenge, we recommend only copying code that you’ve manually typed at least once yourself.

Next, you’ll want to change the value of a square from empty to “X” when the user clicks on the square. With how you’ve built the board so far you would need to copy-paste the code that updates the square nine times (once for each square you have)! Instead of copy-pasting, React’s component architecture allows you to create a reusable component to avoid messy, duplicated code.

First, you are going to copy the line defining your first square (<button className="square">1</button>) from your Board component into a new Square component:

Then you’ll update the Board component to render that Square component using JSX syntax:

Note how unlike the browser divs, your own components Board and Square must start with a capital letter.

Oh no! You lost the numbered squares you had before. Now each square says “1”. To fix this, you will use props to pass the value each square should have from the parent component (Board) to its child (Square).

Update the Square component to read the value prop that you’ll pass from the Board:

function Square({ value }) indicates the Square component can be passed a prop called value.

Now you want to display that value instead of 1 inside every square. Try doing it like this:

Oops, this is not what you wanted:

You wanted to render the JavaScript variable called value from your component, not the word “value”. To “escape into JavaScript” from JSX, you need curly braces. Add curly braces around value in JSX like so:

For now, you should see an empty board:

This is because the Board component hasn’t passed the value prop to each Square component it renders yet. To fix it you’ll add the value prop to each Square component rendered by the Board component:

Now you should see a grid of numbers again:

Your updated code should look like this:

Let’s fill the Square component with an X when you click it. Declare a function called handleClick inside of the Square. Then, add onClick to the props of the button JSX element returned from the Square:

If you click on a square now, you should see a log saying "clicked!" in the Console tab at the bottom of the Browser section in CodeSandbox. Clicking the square more than once will log "clicked!" again. Repeated console logs with the same message will not create more lines in the console. Instead, you will see an incrementing counter next to your first "clicked!" log.

If you are following this tutorial using your local development environment, you need to open your browser’s Console. For example, if you use the Chrome browser, you can view the Console with the keyboard shortcut Shift + Ctrl + J (on Windows/Linux) or Option + ⌘ + J (on macOS).

As a next step, you want the Square component to “remember” that it got clicked, and fill it with an “X” mark. To “remember” things, components use state.

React provides a special function called useState that you can call from your component to let it “remember” things. Let’s store the current value of the Square in state, and change it when the Square is clicked.

Import useState at the top of the file. Remove the value prop from the Square component. Instead, add a new line at the start of the Square that calls useState. Have it return a state variable called value:

value stores the value and setValue is a function that can be used to change the value. The null passed to useState is used as the initial value for this state variable, so value here starts off equal to null.

Since the Square component no longer accepts props anymore, you’ll remove the value prop from all nine of the Square components created by the Board component:

Now you’ll change Square to display an “X” when clicked. Replace the console.log("clicked!"); event handler with setValue('X');. Now your Square component looks like this:

By calling this set function from an onClick handler, you’re telling React to re-render that Square whenever its <button> is clicked. After the update, the Square’s value will be 'X', so you’ll see the “X” on the game board. Click on any Square, and “X” should show up:

Each Square has its own state: the value stored in each Square is completely independent of the others. When you call a set function in a component, React automatically updates the child components inside too.

After you’ve made the above changes, your code will look like this:

React DevTools let you check the props and the state of your React components. You can find the React DevTools tab at the bottom of the browser section in CodeSandbox:

To inspect a particular component on the screen, use the button in the top left corner of React DevTools:

For local development, React DevTools is available as a Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browser extension. Install it, and the Components tab will appear in your browser Developer Tools for sites using React.

By this point, you have all the basic building blocks for your tic-tac-toe game. To have a complete game, you now need to alternate placing “X”s and “O”s on the board, and you need a way to determine a winner.

Currently, each Square component maintains a part of the game’s state. To check for a winner in a tic-tac-toe game, the Board would need to somehow know the state of each of the 9 Square components.

How would you approach that? At first, you might guess that the Board needs to “ask” each Square for that Square’s state. Although this approach is technically possible in React, we discourage it because the code becomes difficult to understand, susceptible to bugs, and hard to refactor. Instead, the best approach is to store the game’s state in the parent Board component instead of in each Square. The Board component can tell each Square what to display by passing a prop, like you did when you passed a number to each Square.

To collect data from multiple children, or to have two child components communicate with each other, declare the shared state in their parent component instead. The parent component can pass that state back down to the children via props. This keeps the child components in sync with each other and with their parent.

Lifting state into a parent component is common when React components are refactored.

Let’s take this opportunity to try it out. Edit the Board component so that it declares a state variable named squares that defaults to an array of 9 nulls corresponding to the 9 squares:

Array(9).fill(null) creates an array with nine elements and sets each of them to null. The useState() call around it declares a squares state variable that’s initially set to that array. Each entry in the array corresponds to the value of a square. When you fill the board in later, the squares array will look like this:

Now your Board component needs to pass the value prop down to each Square that it renders:

Next, you’ll edit the Square component to receive the value prop from the Board component. This will require removing the Square component’s own stateful tracking of value and the button’s onClick prop:

At this point you should see an empty tic-tac-toe board:

And your code should look like this:

Each Square will now receive a value prop that will either be 'X', 'O', or null for empty squares.

Next, you need to change what happens when a Square is clicked. The Board component now maintains which squares are filled. You’ll need to create a way for the Square to update the Board’s state. Since state is private to a component that defines it, you cannot update the Board’s state directly from Square.

Instead, you’ll pass down a function from the Board component to the Square component, and you’ll have Square call that function when a square is clicked. You’ll start with the function that the Square component will call when it is clicked. You’ll call that function onSquareClick:

Next, you’ll add the onSquareClick function to the Square component’s props:

Now you’ll connect the onSquareClick prop to a function in the Board component that you’ll name handleClick. To connect onSquareClick to handleClick you’ll pass a function to the onSquareClick prop of the first Square component:

Lastly, you will define the handleClick function inside the Board component to update the squares array holding your board’s state:

The handleClick function creates a copy of the squares array (nextSquares) with the JavaScript slice() Array method. Then, handleClick updates the nextSquares array to add X to the first ([0] index) square.

Calling the setSquares function lets React know the state of the component has changed. This will trigger a re-render of the components that use the squares state (Board) as well as its child components (the Square components that make up the board).

JavaScript supports closures which means an inner function (e.g. handleClick) has access to variables and functions defined in an outer function (e.g. Board). The handleClick function can read the squares state and call the setSquares method because they are both defined inside of the Board function.

Now you can add X’s to the board… but only to the upper left square. Your handleClick function is hardcoded to update the index for the upper left square (0). Let’s update handleClick to be able to update any square. Add an argument i to the handleClick function that takes the index of the square to update:

Next, you will need to pass that i to handleClick. You could try to set the onSquareClick prop of square to be handleClick(0) directly in the JSX like this, but it won’t work:

Here is why this doesn’t work. The handleClick(0) call will be a part of rendering the board component. Because handleClick(0) alters the state of the board component by calling setSquares, your entire board component will be re-rendered again. But this runs handleClick(0) again, leading to an infinite loop:

Why didn’t this problem happen earlier?

When you were passing onSquareClick={handleClick}, you were passing the handleClick function down as a prop. You were not calling it! But now you are calling that function right away—notice the parentheses in handleClick(0)—and that’s why it runs too early. You don’t want to call handleClick until the user clicks!

You could fix this by creating a function like handleFirstSquareClick that calls handleClick(0), a function like handleSecondSquareClick that calls handleClick(1), and so on. You would pass (rather than call) these functions down as props like onSquareClick={handleFirstSquareClick}. This would solve the infinite loop.

However, defining nine different functions and giving each of them a name is too verbose. Instead, let’s do this:

Notice the new () => syntax. Here, () => handleClick(0) is an arrow function, which is a shorter way to define functions. When the square is clicked, the code after the => “arrow” will run, calling handleClick(0).

Now you need to update the other eight squares to call handleClick from the arrow functions you pass. Make sure that the argument for each call of the handleClick corresponds to the index of the correct square:

Now you can again add X’s to any square on the board by clicking on them:

But this time all the state management is handled by the Board component!

This is what your code should look like:

Now that your state handling is in the Board component, the parent Board component passes props to the child Square components so that they can be displayed correctly. When clicking on a Square, the child Square component now asks the parent Board component to update the state of the board. When the Board’s state changes, both the Board component and every child Square re-renders automatically. Keeping the state of all squares in the Board component will allow it to determine the winner in the future.

Let’s recap what happens when a user clicks the top left square on your board to add an X to it:

In the end the user sees that the upper left square has changed from empty to having an X after clicking it.

The DOM <button> element’s onClick attribute has a special meaning to React because it is a built-in component. For custom components like Square, the naming is up to you. You could give any name to the Square’s onSquareClick prop or Board’s handleClick function, and the code would work the same. In React, it’s conventional to use onSomething names for props which represent events and handleSomething for the function definitions which handle those events.

Note how in handleClick, you call .slice() to create a copy of the squares array instead of modifying the existing array. To explain why, we need to discuss immutability and why immutability is important to learn.

There are generally two approaches to changing data. The first approach is to mutate the data by directly changing the data’s values. The second approach is to replace the data with a new copy which has the desired changes. Here is what it would look like if you mutated the squares array:

And here is what it would look like if you changed data without mutating the squares array:

The result is the same but by not mutating (changing the underlying data) directly, you gain several benefits.

Immutability makes complex features much easier to implement. Later in this tutorial, you will implement a “time travel” feature that lets you review the game’s history and “jump back” to past moves. This functionality isn’t specific to games—an ability to undo and redo certain actions is a common requirement for apps. Avoiding direct data mutation lets you keep previous versions of the data intact, and reuse them later.

There is also another benefit of immutability. By default, all child components re-render automatically when the state of a parent component changes. This includes even the child components that weren’t affected by the change. Although re-rendering is not by itself noticeable to the user (you shouldn’t actively try to avoid it!), you might want to skip re-rendering a part of the tree that clearly wasn’t affected by it for performance reasons. Immutability makes it very cheap for components to compare whether their data has changed or not. You can learn more about how React chooses when to re-render a component in the memo API reference.

It’s now time to fix a major defect in this tic-tac-toe game: the “O”s cannot be marked on the board.

You’ll set the first move to be “X” by default. Let’s keep track of this by adding another piece of state to the Board component:

Each time a player moves, xIsNext (a boolean) will be flipped to determine which player goes next and the game’s state will be saved. You’ll update the Board’s handleClick function to flip the value of xIsNext:

Now, as you click on different squares, they will alternate between X and O, as they should!

But wait, there’s a problem. Try clicking on the same square multiple times:

The X is overwritten by an O! While this would add a very interesting twist to the game, we’re going to stick to the original rules for now.

When you mark a square with an X or an O you aren’t first checking to see if the square already has an X or O value. You can fix this by returning early. You’ll check to see if the square already has an X or an O. If the square is already filled, you will return in the handleClick function early—before it tries to update the board state.

Now you can only add X’s or O’s to empty squares! Here is what your code should look like at this point:

Now that the players can take turns, you’ll want to show when the game is won and there are no more turns to make. To do this you’ll add a helper function called calculateWinner that takes an array of 9 squares, checks for a winner and returns 'X', 'O', or null as appropriate. Don’t worry too much about the calculateWinner function; it’s not specific to React:

It does not matter whether you define calculateWinner before or after the Board. Let’s put it at the end so that you don’t have to scroll past it every time you edit your components.

You will call calculateWinner(squares) in the Board component’s handleClick function to check if a player has won. You can perform this check at the same time you check if a user has clicked a square that already has an X or an O. We’d like to return early in both cases:

To let the players know when the game is over, you can display text such as “Winner: X” or “Winner: O”. To do that you’ll add a status section to the Board component. The status will display the winner if the game is over and if the game is ongoing you’ll display which player’s turn is next:

Congratulations! You now have a working tic-tac-toe game. And you’ve just learned the basics of React too. So you are the real winner here. Here is what the code should look like:

As a final exercise, let’s make it possible to “go back in time” to the previous moves in the game.

If you mutated the squares array, implementing time travel would be very difficult.

However, you used slice() to create a new copy of the squares array after every move, and treated it as immutable. This will allow you to store every past version of the squares array, and navigate between the turns that have already happened.

You’ll store the past squares arrays in another array called history, which you’ll store as a new state variable. The history array represents all board states, from the first to the last move, and has a shape like this:

You will now write a new top-level component called Game to display a list of past moves. That’s where you will place the history state that contains the entire game history.

Placing the history state into the Game component will let you remove the squares state from its child Board component. Just like you “lifted state up” from the Square component into the Board component, you will now lift it up from the Board into the top-level Game component. This gives the Game component full control over the Board’s data and lets it instruct the Board to render previous turns from the history.

First, add a Game component with export default. Have it render the Board component and some markup:

Note that you are removing the export default keywords before the function Board() { declaration and adding them before the function Game() { declaration. This tells your index.js file to use the Game component as the top-level component instead of your Board component. The additional divs returned by the Game component are making room for the game information you’ll add to the board later.

Add some state to the Game component to track which player is next and the history of moves:

Notice how [Array(9).fill(null)] is an array with a single item, which itself is an array of 9 nulls.

To render the squares for the current move, you’ll want to read the last squares array from the history. You don’t need useState for this—you already have enough information to calculate it during rendering:

Next, create a handlePlay function inside the Game component that will be called by the Board component to update the game. Pass xIsNext, currentSquares and handlePlay as props to the Board component:

Let’s make the Board component fully controlled by the props it receives. Change the Board component to take three props: xIsNext, squares, and a new onPlay function that Board can call with the updated squares array when a player makes a move. Next, remove the first two lines of the Board function that call useState:

Now replace the setSquares and setXIsNext calls in handleClick in the Board component with a single call to your new onPlay function so the Game component can update the Board when the user clicks a square:

The Board component is fully controlled by the props passed to it by the Game component. You need to implement the handlePlay function in the Game component to get the game working again.

What should handlePlay do when called? Remember that Board used to call setSquares with an updated array; now it passes the updated squares array to onPlay.

The handlePlay function needs to update Game’s state to trigger a re-render, but you don’t have a setSquares function that you can call any more—you’re now using the history state variable to store this information. You’ll want to update history by appending the updated squares array as a new history entry. You also want to toggle xIsNext, just as Board used to do:

Here, [...history, nextSquares] creates a new array that contains all the items in history, followed by nextSquares. (You can read the ...history spread syntax as “enumerate all the items in history”.)

For example, if history is [[null,null,null], ["X",null,null]] and nextSquares is ["X",null,"O"], then the new [...history, nextSquares] array will be [[null,null,null], ["X",null,null], ["X",null,"O"]].

At this point, you’ve moved the state to live in the Game component, and the UI should be fully working, just as it was before the refactor. Here is what the code should look like at this point:

Since you are recording the tic-tac-toe game’s history, you can now display a list of past moves to the player.

React elements like <button> are regular JavaScript objects; you can pass them around in your application. To render multiple items in React, you can use an array of React elements.

You already have an array of history moves in state, so now you need to transform it to an array of React elements. In JavaScript, to transform one array into another, you can use the array map method:

You’ll use map to transform your history of moves into React elements representing buttons on the screen, and display a list of buttons to “jump” to past moves. Let’s map over the history in the Game component:

You can see what your code should look like below. Note that you should see an error in the developer tools console that says:

You’ll fix this error in the next section.

As you iterate through the history array inside the function you passed to map, the squares argument goes through each element of history, and the move argument goes through each array index: 0, 1, 2, …. (In most cases, you’d need the actual array elements, but to render a list of moves you will only need indexes.)

For each move in the tic-tac-toe game’s history, you create a list item <li> which contains a button <button>. The button has an onClick handler which calls a function called jumpTo (that you haven’t implemented yet).

For now, you should see a list of the moves that occurred in the game and an error in the developer tools console. Let’s discuss what the “key” error means.

When you render a list, React stores some information about each rendered list item. When you update a list, React needs to determine what has changed. You could have added, removed, re-arranged, or updated the list’s items.

Imagine transitioning from

In addition to the updated counts, a human reading this would probably say that you swapped Alexa and Ben’s ordering and inserted Claudia between Alexa and Ben. However, React is a computer program and does not know what you intended, so you need to specify a key property for each list item to differentiate each list item from its siblings. If your data was from a database, Alexa, Ben, and Claudia’s database IDs could be used as keys.

When a list is re-rendered, React takes each list item’s key and searches the previous list’s items for a matching key. If the current list has a key that didn’t exist before, React creates a component. If the current list is missing a key that existed in the previous list, React destroys the previous component. If two keys match, the corresponding component is moved.

Keys tell React about the identity of each component, which allows React to maintain state between re-renders. If a component’s key changes, the component will be destroyed and re-created with a new state.

key is a special and reserved property in React. When an element is created, React extracts the key property and stores the key directly on the returned element. Even though key may look like it is passed as props, React automatically uses key to decide which components to update. There’s no way for a component to ask what key its parent specified.

It’s strongly recommended that you assign proper keys whenever you build dynamic lists. If you don’t have an appropriate key, you may want to consider restructuring your data so that you do.

If no key is specified, React will report an error and use the array index as a key by default. Using the array index as a key is problematic when trying to re-order a list’s items or inserting/removing list items. Explicitly passing key={i} silences the error but has the same problems as array indices and is not recommended in most cases.

Keys do not need to be globally unique; they only need to be unique between components and their siblings.

In the tic-tac-toe game’s history, each past move has a unique ID associated with it: it’s the sequential number of the move. Moves will never be re-ordered, deleted, or inserted in the middle, so it’s safe to use the move index as a key.

In the Game function, you can add the key as <li key={move}>, and if you reload the rendered game, React’s “key” error should disappear:

Before you can implement jumpTo, you need the Game component to keep track of which step the user is currently viewing. To do this, define a new state variable called currentMove, defaulting to 0:

Next, update the jumpTo function inside Game to update that currentMove. You’ll also set xIsNext to true if the number that you’re changing currentMove to is even.

You will now make two changes to the Game’s handlePlay function which is called when you click on a square.

Finally, you will modify the Game component to render the currently selected move, instead of always rendering the final move:

If you click on any step in the game’s history, the tic-tac-toe board should immediately update to show what the board looked like after that step occurred.

If you look at the code very closely, you may notice that xIsNext === true when currentMove is even and xIsNext === false when currentMove is odd. In other words, if you know the value of currentMove, then you can always figure out what xIsNext should be.

There’s no reason for you to store both of these in state. In fact, always try to avoid redundant state. Simplifying what you store in state reduces bugs and makes your code easier to understand. Change Game so that it doesn’t store xIsNext as a separate state variable and instead figures it out based on the currentMove:

You no longer need the xIsNext state declaration or the calls to setXIsNext. Now, there’s no chance for xIsNext to get out of sync with currentMove, even if you make a mistake while coding the components.

Congratulations! You’ve created a tic-tac-toe game that:

Nice work! We hope you now feel like you have a decent grasp of how React works.

If you have extra time or want to practice your new React skills, here are some ideas for improvements that you could make to the tic-tac-toe game, listed in order of increasing difficulty:

Throughout this tutorial, you’ve touched on React concepts including elements, components, props, and state. Now that you’ve seen how these concepts work when building a game, check out Thinking in React to see how the same React concepts work when building an app’s UI.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (jsx):
```jsx
export default function Square() {  return <button className="square">X</button>;}
```

Example 2 (jsx):
```jsx
export default function Square() {  return <button className="square">X</button>;}
```

Example 3 (jsx):
```jsx
export default function Square() {  return <button className="square">X</button>;}
```

Example 4 (sql):
```sql
import { StrictMode } from 'react';import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';import './styles.css';import App from './App';
```
